It's not that big a deal.", "What?", "(Mortified) Hi.", "At the vet.", "She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase.

The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.", "Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state.

She's a stealer.", "Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.", "(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.", "Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?", "Where exactly is your zoo?", "Yes.", "No-no, he's, he's very docile.", "Well I, I don't know. Why?", "He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...", "Why- why- why would he need a blade?", "He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!", "Aww.

Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?", "(buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.", "Oh.", "Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.", "Bye sweetie.", "(blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.", "Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.

Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!", "(gasps) You are? Me, too!", "(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall?

And then when I turned around she was gone.", "But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.", "I gotta go find her.", "Evidently they do.", "Hi!", "Uh we-we need to talk.", "Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.", "What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I\u0092m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel\u0092s feet) really\u0097I should have been thinking about you Rach\u0085", "Right! Right! I just\u0097I want you to know that I\u0092m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor\u0092s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment\u0097Although we could probably worry about that \u0091til after we get married.", "Well yeah, I think we should get married.", "No, because that\u0092s the right thing to do.", "No but\u0085but still you can\u0092t possibly do this alone.", "Come on Rach, you can\u0092t even eat alone in a restaurant.", "I\u0092m just saying if you can\u0092t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?", "When have you ever?", "Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!", "I grew up with Monica! If you didn\u0092t eat fast you didn\u0092t eat!!", "But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.", "(To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don\u0092t know why you can\u0092t admit that you need me.", "Oh my God.", "Thank you.", "Pretty amazing huh?", "What? What?!", "You-you just said that you did!", "Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it\u0092s-it\u0092s-it\u0092s, it\u0092s right there (Points).", "Do you really?", "Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?

(He takes the picture and hugs her.", "Hello!", "So, how was the honeymoon?", "(glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)", "(laughs) Umm that\u0092s\u0085that\u0092s a little misleading.", "The lie you just told.", "There\u0092s the one!", "Yes let\u0092s. Y\u0092know what? Uh, it\u0092s-it\u0092s not important. What is important is that, is that we\u0092re having a baby. And it\u0092s not\u0097Doesn\u0092t matter who came on to who.", "What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!", "Yeah!", "Y\u0092know what?! It doesn\u0092t matter! It doesn\u0092t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!", "Y\u0092know what? Y\u0092know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.", "I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It\u0092s an expression.", "(entering) Rachel won\u0092t talk to me! She won\u0092t even open the door!", "Okay, listen I am not a pervert!", "Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here\u0092s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.", "About\u0085about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn\u0092t had sex in months?", "Hey!", "Do you have a minute? I\u0092d like to talk to you about something I\u0092m, I\u0092m really uncomfortable talking about.", "I actually had a topic in mind! I\u0092m, I\u0092m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.", "Five to be lying, six.", "Well, I mean it\u0092s not all bad. I\u0092m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.", "Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay\u0097I\u0092m scared for my health!", "Really? Well then tell it to me.", "(sarcastic) I\u0092ll try to control myself.", "(laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?", "(stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I\u0092m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?", "(intently listening) Why?", "It\u0092s from France\u0085In Europe\u0085Western Europe. Y\u0092know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.", "Uh-hmm\u0097Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.", "Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking\u0085", "(whines) Oh that\u0092s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo\u0085", "Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!", "Great! I\u0092m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!", "No! No, I don\u0092t\u0085don\u0092t want to.", "I was backpacking across Western Europe.", "I was just outside Barcelona, hiking\u0085", "It\u0092s been six months! I\u0092m always hot!", "I\u0092ll try that.", "Thanks.", "Thanks. And-and hey Joe?", "Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I\u0092ll help you out.", "Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!", "Hi!", "That\u0092s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.", "(voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.", "What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!", "Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, \"You\u0092ll show me right?\") No!", "Joey! No!", "Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn\u0092t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)", "Forget it, she\u0092s destroying it.", "Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It\u0092s Rachel\u0092s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.", "What?!", "I don\u0092t want people to see it for your sake.", "Rachel, please\u0085", "Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I\u0092m gonna be saying\u0085(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)", "(on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?", "(on tape) You didn\u0092t do it?", "(pause) Not on the ones we sent out.", "(on tape) I know. Hey remember\u0085remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost\u0085", "(on tape) I mean I\u0085I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn\u0092t sure if you wanted to.", "(on tape) So we\u0085we both wanted to.", "(on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.", "And in about five seconds you\u0092re gonna see why.", "Now I\u0092m so happy.", "Hi.", "Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn\u0092t matter. I mean, I think it would\u0092ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn\u0092t initiated it I-I-I know I would\u0092ve.", "It was. It was an amazing night.", "I uh\u0085 I don\u0092t know. I mean I\u0085I honestly didn\u0092t watch it.", "Uhhhhhh\u0085that-that may be weird.", "Good luck.", "Mind if I mute?", "Oh, oh there go the clothes.", "Six months Rachel, six months.", "Hey. We-we look\u0085we look pretty good.", "Oh nice tan!", "Ah\u0085.", "I have been working out.", "Oh that\u0092s not pretty.", "No!", "Oh no!", "Oh no!!", "No!!", "No!!!", "(running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.", "Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.", "Yeah!", "Yeah!!", "I\u0092m telling you, I like the food!", "Did that guy just call you Toby?", "Well, why don\u0092t you correct him?", "Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!", "(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler", "Bing? It\u0092s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!", "Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?", "(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!", "So, what do you want to do tonight? There\u0092s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that\u0092s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?", "Rach? You wanna come?", "A date?", "Why no, it\u0092s the opposite of weird. It\u0092s-it\u0092s uh, regular. It\u0092s-it\u0092s uh, it\u0092s mundane. It\u0092s actually uh, a little dull.", "A date?! She\u0092s-she\u0092s got a date?! With who?", "You set her up?!", "Joey what-what were you thinking?!", "Joey, I\u0092m not worried about her! I\u0092m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?", "A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!", "Why don\u0092t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that\u0092s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That\u0092s fun too! Whew!!", "Hi. I-I hear you\u0092re going on a ferry tonight.", "A bit of a daredevil are we?", "Okay. Have a great time you guys.", "Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)", "Books?", "Well, I tell you what. Why don\u0092t we uh, why don\u0092t we just stay here? Let\u0092s not see a movie, we\u0092ll just hang.", "Hey, if that\u0092s what you want to do I\u0092m not gonna say no.", "I just\u0085I have to find out how it went.", "This guy could be my baby\u0092s stepfather!", "I just\u0097I-I can\u0092t believe she\u0092s-she\u0092s dating?!", "I don\u0092t know! I guess I just can\u0092t believe any of this is happening.", "It\u0092s just I always thought when I had", "kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan\u0092s, it\u0092s like\u0097It breaks my heart a little. I mean I\u0092ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y\u0092know? Maybe fight over the science section.", "No! No I can\u0092t. I mean Rachel\u0092s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.", "It used to be. Now she doesn\u0092t really have a face. Smokin\u0092 body though.", "No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?", "No, it\u0092s not what I want either. I mean I-I can\u0092t force myself to fall in love with her again now.", "Yeah.", "(checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.", "Hello.", "Well, how was the date?", "Uh-huh. What happened?", "Ah, he didn\u0092t uh, take it so well?", "Oh?", "He sounds swell.", "Hey, wanna\u0085wanna a little cheering up?", "Sit down.", "Guess whose middle name is Muriel.", "Yeah-ha!", "I\u0092m sorry about your date.", "Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months you\u0092re gonna have something that you\u0092re gonna love more than any guy you\u0092ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.", "You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?", "Hey, I thought I cheered you up.", "Right. Good night.", "Yeah?", "Oh hi!", "Wow! Uh\u0085how are you?", "Oh that\u0092s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?", "Great! Well umm\u0085", "Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.", "What?", "Well, I\u0092ll-I\u0092ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so\u0085", "(exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.", "Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.", "Yeah.", "That\u0092s right! He was hitting on her, and", "got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don\u0092t take her from me.", "(entering) Hey! (He\u0092s wearing a costume as well.)", "Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, I\u0092m a potato or a\u0085spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he\u0092s wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes\u0085 (They\u0092re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!", "No, I-I\u0092m not doody.", "Hey!", "You made it!", "Well, I\u0092m a spud\u0085", "Yes!", "That\u0092s funny. Yeah. Y\u0092know you\u0092re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.", "Uh, in her defense, she\u0092s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.", "Oh I\u0092ll prove it! I\u0092ll prove it like a theorem!!", "Oh yeah? You\u0092re going further down! Downtown!", "Pride.", "(To Chandler) So, you gettin\u0092 tired?", "Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin\u0092 a little tired though.", "Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona\u0092s standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, she\u0092s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!", "Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin\u0092 people up! And I\u0092m dressed as doody.", "Come on, who are we kidding? I\u0092m doody. Please? She\u0092s watchin\u0092.", "(celebrating) Oh yeah!", "Yeah?", "Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler", "me win.

I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.", "Well I don\u0092t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. No. No you\u0092re right.", "Yeah.", "Hi. I\u0092m Ross Geller. I live in the building.", "I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I\u0092m so sorry for your loss.", "What?", "Oh, thank God!", "Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)", "Y\u0092know I would it\u0092s just painful.", "Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.

(Flowers in Dutch.)", "Oh I don\u0092t know that it would.", "All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)", "Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don\u0092t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!", "(stutters looking for words) Ezels!!", "Oh thanks.

It\u0092s going good. I mean, we get along great. She\u0092s, she\u0092s so\u0085", "Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!", "Well I\u0085I haven\u0092t actually told her yet. I don\u0092t want to scare her off, y\u0092know?", "Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his agreement.)", "Uh actually, sorry I can\u0092t even make it. I\u0092m seeing Mona again tonight.", "Uh that\u0092s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.", "So much more.", "Aw forget it, it\u0092s from", ". (There\u0092s an angry knock on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)", "Y\u0092know this is actually not a great time for me.", "Who did?!", "Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.", "No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care\u0097I-I love Rachel.", "(to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean\u0085I mean I\u0092m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.", "(to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!", "(To Mona) But I didn\u0092t want to.", "I\u0092m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.", "I was going to tell you, but\u0085", "Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The phone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he\u0092s trapped behind the apothecary table by Dr. Green.) Can I just\u0085 (Dr. Green glares at him.)

Look I\u0085I made a mistake, but it\u0092s only because I really, really like you. Really!", "(entering) Will!", "Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?", "Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?", "Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.", "Oh! Man I don\u0092t think I\u0092ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis\u0092 graduation party.", "Yeah. It would\u0092ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.", "Yeah.", "(laughs) Yeah.", "So how long are you in town?", "Aw\u0097oh, that\u0092s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?", "Will, high school was-was a long time ago.", "No need to point, she knows who Ross is.", "No. No.", "Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don\u0092t think he-he knew what it was.", "That was in high school! It\u0092s not like it was binding forever.", "Look Rach I-I\u0092m sorry, okay? I\u0085I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined\u0085", "\u0085co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn\u0092t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.", "No-no! No-no. No-no.", "It was no big deal. We-we\u0085said that the rumor was\u0085that umm\u0085you had both\u0085male and female reproductive parts.", "Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one\u0092s not really our fault.", "Rach, I think you\u0092re reading a little too much into it.", "Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn\u0092t true?!", "Well look-look I\u0092m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!", "What?", "(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!", "No.", "Hey! She didn\u0092t look 50!", "She didn\u0092t photograph well!", "I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble.

I mean we are having a baby together.", "Yeah.", "Nope.", "That\u0092s right, I love you! And-and I\u0092m gonna play with you all the time.", "Bye.", "Yeah. Why?", "Yeah I know; he\u0092s in Ben\u0092s class.", "Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?

The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?", "Uh, I actually haven\u0092t even met him.", "Well actually, I\u0092m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he\u0092ll be there.", "(entering) Hey!", "Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school\u0085", "I dropped him off at Carol\u0092s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that I\u0092m not going to be able to get those tickets though.", "Well it turns out that Ben and Sting\u0092s son do not get along.", "Apparently, Sting\u0092s son made fun of the fact that Ben\u0092s moms are lesbinims.", "Phoebe, you can\u0092t force kids to be friends.", "Playpen?! Ben\u0092s seven!", "Look I\u0092m sorry Pheebs, I can\u0092t do it.", "What?", "Look Phoebe, I\u0092m sorry it\u0092s just\u0085", "Phoebe, I\u0085", "You\u0092re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)", "Well\u0085let\u0092s just say\u0085 (singing)", "!", "Uh, middle balcony.", "Yeah.", "Hi!", "Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?", "Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?", "Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y\u0092know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.", "(pause) Together? Like-like to people?", "Okay. (Not happy about it.)", "Uh sure, sure.", "I know. Can you believe that?", "Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!", "Hey!", "Huh. Wow, this is great.", "Well, we-we haven\u0092t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.", "A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I\u0092ll take a\u0097Mona, uh\u0085I-I\u0092m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.", "Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don\u0092t know if we\u0092re really quite there yet.", "Yeah.", "Huh.", "Hmm\u0085", "Let\u0092s do the card!", "The card! I think we\u0092re there!", "Really?! I mean, even with the card?", "(entering) Hey!", "Oh yeah, yeah we\u0092re moving forward. You\u0092ll be getting our card!", "Yeah, we\u0092re not just doing a card! Y\u0092know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.", "I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, \"So, where is this going?\"", "Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I\u0092m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I\u0092m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture.

We were closer with the mixed tape.", "Yeah I-I don\u0092t-I don\u0092t think I\u0092m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.", "Forget it. I-I\u0097Y\u0092know what? I\u0092ll just have the conversation. I\u0092ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?", "Here we go. Mona umm, I think it\u0092s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.", "Aw, we-we are so\u0085(Motions that they\u0092re connected.) So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y\u0092know hanging out with you. And I mean-I\u0092m having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there isn\u0092t.)", "I mean, there\u0092s no point in spending time with someone if-if it\u0092s just fun. It\u0092s gotta be, it\u0092s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That\u0092s-that\u0092s the real question. And-and the answer is\u0085is it\u0092s going somewhere\u0085fun. Now I-I know what you\u0092re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y\u0092know, but you\u0092re-you\u0092re not getting any younger. No I mean\u0097No not you, not you, you\u0097you", "getting younger. I mean\u0097you-you look like you\u0092re getting younger by the second\u0097What\u0092s your secret?", "Well, well to sum up, we\u0092re having fun, you look young.", "But that\u0092s not enough. So\u0085 So\u0085here\u0092s a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)", "Really.", "Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.", "Oh great, I live on the street.", "Okay, and oh I\u0092m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.", "No. That guy is.", "I\u0092m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.", "I love you!", "Hey! Oh, I\u0092m so glad you guys are here. I\u0092ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.", "Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so\u0085.", "No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn\u0092t I get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)", "\u0085which brings us back, of course, to Greely\u0092s theory of dominance. (The bell rings.) Okay, that-that\u0092s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?", "What?! That-that\u0092s all the way cross town, I\u0092m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.", "Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I\u0092m the teacher!!", "Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I\u0092m sorry I\u0092m a little late. Ah\u0097(Checks his watch)\u0097Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up, I\u0092m Professor Geller. Good job today.", "No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, \"Get the hell out of my way!\"", "Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it\u0092ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?", "Well I have to. Okay? If I don\u0092t, they\u0092ll take the class away from me. And\u0085I already put it in my family newsletter.", "You\u0092ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.", "Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I\u0092m sure I can make it this time. I just\u0085I just can\u0092t be afraid to get a little bit\u0085hit by cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)", "Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I\u0092m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay, why don\u0092t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where\u0085 (Exhales again) Where you will see\u0085a uh\u0085a bunch of uh\u0085red spots. Okay, (Closes his book.) umm, why don\u0092t, why don\u0092t you all start to read, while I\u0097(Passes out and collapses.)", "Phoebe!!", "So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, he\u0092s wearing in-line skates and hasn\u0092t taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs\u0085", "(crying) I hope you\u0092re a better father than you\u0092re a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)", "Hey!", "What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel\u0092s belly.)", "Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?", "My God, the baby\u0092s kicking. That\u0092s great. Although I\u0085kinda wish I-I would\u0092ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y\u0092know.", "Look, I-I don\u0092t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So\u0085Here. Here\u0092s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I\u0092ll be there! Okay? I don\u0092t care if it\u0092s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.", "(rushes in) Is everything okay?", "Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?", "Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don\u0092t even feel them.", "Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.", "No I\u0097Mona!", "What? Why? What\u0092s wrong?", "No really, you tell me what\u0092s up.", "(To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.", "Yeah but still, I mean it should\u0092ve been me. I\u0092m the dad.", "Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.", "Well yeah!", "What?! What?! Rach what?!", "I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.", "(to Rachel) I-I\u0092m sorry Rach, I didn\u0092t know. Are you gonna be okay?", "I can\u0092t believe this! I shouldn\u0092t be the one making her throw up!", "Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don\u0092t know any of it and I\u0092m the father. I wish I\u0092d be more involved y\u0092know.", "Yeah.", "No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.", "So? Sure! But it-it wouldn\u0092t be anything romantic. And I\u0092m-I\u0092m dating Mona\u0097Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!", "No! No it\u0092s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.", "Really?", "Oh Rach that\u0092s great. That\u0092s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)", "(closes the door) Did you um\u0097I\u0092m sorry, did you just say it\u0092s Rachel?", "Um, you\u0085you like Rachel?", "Rachel?!", "But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!", "It\u0092s not a big deal? Oh, I\u0092m sorry I just\u0085um, I\u0085what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like\u0097you-you can\u0092t stop thinking about her. Like how you can\u0092t sleep?", "Rachel who\u0092s carrying my baby? Rachel?", "Y\u0092know what? I-I gotta go.

Then he\u0092d be the stepfather of my child.", "Sure, because women never like Joey. Y\u0092know, I think he\u0092s a virgin.", "He\u0092s not?", "Why?", "Hate him? I\u0085 No, I don\u0092t hate him. (Pause) It\u0092s just it\u0092s Rachel, y\u0092know?", "Okay. Okay, I\u0092ll talk to him.", "Hey.", "No, I don\u0092t want to hit you.", "No.", "No, no I don\u0092t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I\u0092m not mad at you and\u0085and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)", "Uh\u0085yeah sure. (Enters.)", "Okay.", "Thank you.", "What?! You\u0092re in love with her.", "Umm, no.", "I think you need to tell her how you feel.", "No, I\u0092m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she\u0092s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.", "If she is where you are then uh\u0085then my feeling weird about it shouldn\u0092t stand in the way.", "Yeah. Look if-if she\u0092s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn\u0092t find a better guy. So\u0085", "So when do you think you\u0092re gonna talk to her?", "I\u0092m understanding, but let\u0092s not get carried away.", "Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)", "(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It\u0092s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?", "Faded salmon color.", "Great! Great. Then I must\u0092ve left it at Mona\u0092s. I knew it!", "That\u0092s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!", "I don\u0092t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It\u0092s just that we didn\u0092t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I\u0092d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)", "Mona? (There\u0092s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona\u0092s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)", "Hello!!", "Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.", "(on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There\u0092s a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in. (She does so.) I\u0092m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I\u0092m really sorry. It\u0092s just that I\u0085 (He picks up the pink shirt.)", "You do?", "(faking starting to cry) Oh God you\u0092re right.", "(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)", "Sure. Yeah.", "Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20", "?", "Okay, hopefully this time mom won\u0092t boo you.", "Hey!", "Aww that is so cool.", "(picking up Chi-Chi\u0092s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y\u0092know Monica couldn\u0092t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.", "You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!", "Ah, actually, I\u0092m sorry we-we probably should get going.", "Well, there is an", "in the shape of a tee-pee.", "So uh, he seems like a nice guy.", "Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?", "Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.", "That\u0092s a good question, dad. That\u0092s a good question\u0085", "Wha\u0097What?", "Dad so what we have to pretend that we\u0092re married?", "Can you believe that?", "No, us having to lie about being married.", "Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan", "We love marriage!", "Hey", "I\u0092m so we weren\u0092t in the car! Did he ever let up?", "(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry\u0085(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)", "That depends, how much did you hear?", "What was wrong with Mona?", "Yeah baby!", "No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.", "Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm\u0085. what are you doing?", "Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a", ".", "Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That\u0092s-that\u0092s where we had our first date.

Um, I-I just wanted to say\u0085on behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if\u0085if in 35 years, we\u0092re half as happy as you guys are, we\u0092ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.", "\u0085and then, we could\u0092ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!", "But having a dove place the ring on your finger would\u0092ve been no problem?", "Yeah!

It\u0092s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.", "It\u0092s a good thing I didn\u0092t do it, because it sounds like it would\u0092ve been a very expensive wedding.

It was a beautiful speech.", "Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would\u0092ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.", "Hey!", "Why\u0092d you say no?", "Just then or-or all the time, \u0091cause we-we have jobs y\u0092know.", "Shhh!

We totally forgot about lunch!", "It tastes like feet!", "Are you kidding?", "(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.", "Yeah, so far nothing stupid.", "Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.", "Yeah, you too.", "All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).", "Wait a minute! I saw that! On", ", yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!", "Your make-up!", "Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we\u0092re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we\u0092re-we\u0092re butt to face.", "I would say that.", "Okay, here I go.", "I prefer not to answer that right now, I\u0092m still carrying a little holiday weight.", "It really was.", "Hi Jill.", "Amazing! Amazing!", "Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.", "Did you just wink at me?", "Oh cool!", "Well do you want some help?", "Awesome!", "(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!", "Well uh, I-I\u0092m a paleontologist.

How do you test the temperature of the baby\u0092s bath water?", "Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?", "That\u0092s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)", "Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?", "Oh, I\u0092m sorry you\u0092ve been Bamboozled! You\u0092re gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I\u0092ve lost sight of why we\u0092re doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)", "Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)", "No, Monica\u0092s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn\u0092t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.

What?", "Are ya?", "What are you doing up?", "Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after\u0085", "It\u0092s funny you should mention diapers.", "Okay look, there\u0092s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There\u0092s a great baby furniture store on west 10", ". Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?", "(interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you\u0092re gonna do this, then I\u0092m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So\u0085 (Starts for the bathroom.)", "(annoyed) Yeah!", "(stunned) (thinks) Well uh\u0085", "Oh.", "We are having a baby together, but we\u0092re not involved. (The cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we\u0092d like this delivered please.", "Oh, okay.", "I chose those, I\u0092m a paleontologist.", "Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.", "That\u0092s my gym.", "I", "like Indiana Jones.", "My son? Pretty serious. (There\u0092s a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?", "Ah, must\u0092ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.", "Oh.

(Katie laughs) Not-not because I\u0092m-I\u0092m into S&M. (Katie\u0092s worried again.) I\u0092m not-I\u0092m not into anything weird. Y\u0092know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So, I\u0092m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)", "Hey.", "How are you?", "Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.", "What\u0092s uh, what\u0092s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?", "I liked her.", "Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!", "Why? What was wrong with her?", "Okay, so what\u0092s the matter?", "(laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?", "Okay.", "I won\u0092t date. I\u0092ll uh, I\u0092ll be here, with you, all the time.", "True, but you\u0092re allowed to be unreasonable. You\u0092re having our baby.", "Do you feel better?", "Uh Rach?", "Just one thing umm\u0085", "We live together. You\u0092re having our baby. I\u0092m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don\u0092t want something more?", "Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin\u0092 around! (She\u0092s stunned) Like you did last night when I had to pee?", "(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you\u0085", "\u0085that you actually\u0085", "Rach?", "The bathroom?", "Hey! What are you guys looking at?", "Yeah? Wow! It looks", "violent!", "Now I cannot wait to see this.", "Uh sweetie, maybe you\u0092d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)", "Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it\u0092s the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I\u0092d be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)", "(entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor\u0092s appointment.", "Rach, we gotta go.", "People ask me why we\u0092re not together, I just don\u0092t know what to tell them.", "Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor\u0092s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry\u0085", "Really? You don\u0092t think that\u0092s a little inappropriate.

Nothing! Just uh, you\u0092ve been a little short with me lately. I\u0092m not trying to irritate you.", "Y\u0092know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don\u0092t we not speak until then.", "Y\u0092know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that\u0092s half human and half pure evil!", "(to Rachel) Oh, you\u0092re nice to her.", "Do them!!", "You\u0092ve got to be kidding me!", "Hey.", "Yeah, we tried them all.

Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.", "Whazzup??", "Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today.

Crab cake?", "Well, what happened?", "Monica told me you had a blind date.", "I did, too.", "But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?", "Why does everyone keep saying that?", "That bad?", "Female body inspector? What size is that?", "The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.", "Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.", "I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?", "Oh yeah, let me just finish this.", "Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.", "It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?", "Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...", "No... I already e-mailed her.", "You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.", "(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??

I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!", "(visibly upset) I'm dead?", "Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.", "Oh please, hit by a blimp?", "Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls.

Your coming out is about to get real graphic.", "uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)", "Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little \"Ross is dead\" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?", "What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!", "I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)", "You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.", "Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)", "No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!", "oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...", "It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!", "Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!

(they press their ears against the door)", "(coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?", "It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!", "Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?", "(sceptical) Yeah...", "(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!

I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?", "Hi!", "I'd love to!", "Phoebe, what happened?", "Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.", "Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!", "Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird?

I take six!", "C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!", "I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?", "(on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?

God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!", "Oh, that's not cool.", "No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.

But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...", "(entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys!

Wh-what's wrong?", "I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.", "(looking at them) Wh-what's going on?", "No, I arranged that...", "(to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?", "Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?", "You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?", "... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...", "Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!", "(very interested) Oh! like what?!

Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart", "Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who", "won the Nobel Prize?", "Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?", "Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)", "(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.", "She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.

No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them.

Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!", "Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.", "Yeah, most of it it's a place", "with confused angry baseball fans!", "Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.", "But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...", "Ok.", "Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing.

I wrote that out phonetically for you.", "Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.", "Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!", "Wow. What does", "mean?", "Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?", "Nah ah! Nah ah!

But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.", "What?", "What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.", "(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.", "And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you.

NO!

He got phased out!", "Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate.

With Danny.", "That yeti is one smooth talker.", "Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.", "Come on you guys!

You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!", "What?!", "Okay,", "we may be able to do.", "Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.", "Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.", "Yeah.", "Then, you will", "get him back!", "Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.", "Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.)

I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!", "That was", "funny!", "Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!", "Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?", "(sees the picture) Oh my God!

Okay, you go!", "Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.", "I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, \"I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.\" And he said, \"Laundry? Is", "my new nickname?\" And you said, \"No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.\"", "Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.", "What?!", "All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.", "Sure! Why?", "What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!", "Hey! Hi!", "Well, I was actually\u0097I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.", "Yeah!", "Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.", "That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!", "Okay.", "'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)", "Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.", "Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!", "What?", "Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?", "Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?", "Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)", "It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.", "No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look,", ", carrying the bag.", "Exactly! Unisex!", "No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.", "(entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.", "Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.", "All right, then you owe me $350.", "(glaring at him) Joey\u0085", "Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.", "Hi sweetie!", "Why?! Why not?!", "Okay.", "Ahhh, I think you look", "! That bag is gonna get you that part.", "Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?", "What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!", "Honey wait, Joey, I\u0092m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it\u0085 (Looks for help.)", "\u0085I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.", "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn\u0092t have a bag, I just\u0097it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause) controversial.", "I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.", "Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.", "Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.", "Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)", "What?!", "Oh my God!", "OH MY GOD!!!", "Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!", "I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!", "Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!", "Phoebe and", "Ohhh!!!", "(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!", "Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!", "Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.", "Joey! Come here! Come here!", "Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.", "No. Joey, she", "! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up", "the window.", "Wh-what do you mean?", "Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!", "Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.", "You don't have any secrets!", "(To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?", "Okay.", "Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?", "Oh.", "Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!", "Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?", "Oh.", "What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?", "All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.", "Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!", "Y'know what you should do?", "You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.", "(To Ross) See?", "Yeah, he broke those too.", "Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.", "Are you kidding?!", "I can not believe he would do that to Mon\u0097Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?", "Joey!", "Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!", "All right. Be sexy.", "Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is", "friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)", "Show time!", "Okay! (She runs to get some.)", "(handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!", "Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)", "Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)", "Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.", "Okay!", "(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!", "Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.", "Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.", "Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.", "Okay.", "She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!", "Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?", "Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.", "Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.", "And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.", "Umm, Chandler, you", "realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.", "Well, because she loves you and because you love her.", "Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.", "No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.", "Not unless different means the same.", "Hi! Wow! You look, you look\u0085big.", "Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.", "Hey! Hey, cute jacket!", "Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, \"You see what I mean?!\")", "Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)", "Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)", "Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)", "Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)", "Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?", "(looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.", "A couple of bucks.", "Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.", "Hey Joey!", "(disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!", "What?! You say that to kids?!!", "Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.", "Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!", "Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?", "(Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!", "Ross!", "Ross!", "Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.", "(To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.", "Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are", "a loser!", "Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?", "Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!", "Yeah.", "Oh-oh!", "Any chance you think the couch looks good there?", "(entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?", "(noticing him) What's up Joey?", "Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?", "Thanks!", "I know.", "What's up Joe?", "Yeah?", "(laughing) What are you saying?", "Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.", "(laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm\u0085 No honey, listen I think it's a", "idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!", "Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's", "worth the wait.", "(entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.", "Well, I brought the next best thing.", "Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)", "Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.", "Okay!", "Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.", "Chandler and", "You think?!", "I know, me neither! I mean, you", "a sketch!", "Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?", "What?! Why?!", "Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!", "Good, you guys are all here!", "Well, I have a job interview at", "tomorrow!", "I know!", "Wh-what?!", "Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!", "Yeah.", "O-okay!", "Hi.", "Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!", "No!", "Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, \"Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!\" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!", "(We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me\u0085 Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh\u0085 (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)", "Well, I didn't know what else to do!", "Thanks Chandler.", "I can't believe it! I got a second interview!", "What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?", "I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause \"Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!\"", "Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?", "Maybe. I-I don't know\u0097Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!", "Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.", "Hi!", "Thank you.", "What?", "Excuse me?", "(stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am", "some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want,", "job", "bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)", "(entering) Ugh, you will not", "what that sleaze-ball from", "did too me!", "Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?", "Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh\u0085.", "Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.", "(looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.", "Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.\u00a0 So she didn't want to sue him. \u00a0 Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr\u0085", "Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.", "(gasps) Oh! You are?", "Really? Oh thank you! Oh\u0085 Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?", "Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that\u0097I mean", "there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so\u0097Hey! I'll see you Monday! (Exits.)", "(laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!", "Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.", "(entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!", "Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very", "day\u0085", "Okay guys, way to wish me luck!", "Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.", "(laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.", "Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories\u0085(stops and tries to change directions)\u0085about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.", "\u0085and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!", "I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!", "I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?", "Yeah, I can do that.", "I would love to!", "Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.", "Oh great!", "Oh that's okay.", "Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually\u0085 (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?", "Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, \"Wow, those guys are crazy!\" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.", "Oh, me too.", "(Laughs) Oh, me too.", "Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.", "Thanks!", "Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.", "I did not!", "All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!", "No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.", "I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)", "Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.", "Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!", "Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!", "Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)", "Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's lighter.)", "Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!", "Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!", "Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?", "Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.", "Okay. (Starts to walk away.)", "(hearing that) Oh man!", "What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!", "Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!", "Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.", "Oh, okay, not so weird.", "I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on", "!", "No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.", "What's going on?", "Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been", "since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.", "Hm-mmm.", "Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.", "Big night!", "Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her room.)", "(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!", "Oh what, you-you want both of them?", "Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I", "lost it.", "Tell her to wear her own earrings.", "Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!", "Because I lose her stuff!", "Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!", "Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!", "Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.", "But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.", "Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then", "nine years later you had me!", "Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?", "Okay that is the one we already have!", "(smiling) What?!", "(smiling) Yeah.", "(smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.", "It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)", "Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?", "(entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!", "The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)", "Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)", "I don't know, I don't know.", "Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.", "Ohh that'd be great!", "Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent", "the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)", "Your sunglasses?!", "Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to\u0085 (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)", "I'm sorry.", "Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)", "Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?", "No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.", "Yeah.", "I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.", "Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.", "Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?", "(entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.", "Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)", "Yeah!", "I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.", "Yay!", "Hey!", "Ohh, thank God!", "!", "Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.", "Great! Thanks!", "Okay.", "Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?", "Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?", "No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.", "Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?", "What?!", "Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)", "Hey! What's up?!", "So all we have is ice?", "Okay.", "Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)", "(does Monica's) I know!", "What?! We can't do that!", "Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn\u0092t give us the right to erase his message!", "I don't think he's the one who needs help.", "Ugh!", "Okay,", "are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)", "Noooooooo!", "No, wait. Wait.", "No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!", "Yeah well unless we tell him.", "Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.", "Right?", "Hey! Hi!", "Hey! Y'know what?", "are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!", "Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?", "What?! What? What happened?!", "Yeah!", "(gasps) Really?!", "Because a car backfired?", "Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole \"seizing\" thing but um, Emily called you today.", "No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.", "Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.", "Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?", "Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because\u0097I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me\u0097not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.", "Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you", "want to get back into that?", "Ugh, Ross! That was", "a near death experience! That was barely an experience!", "Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.", "I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to", "getting back together with Emily?", "Well, there you go!", "(laughing) Close call day.", "Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)", "Oh?", "No. (She heads for the door again.)", "Yeah.", "(going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?", "(entering) Hey, you guys\u0085", "Is Monica here?", "All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.", "Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?", "Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!", "It's a, it's a cat!", "Yes it is!", "Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!", "Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.", "A thousand bucks.", "All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!", "Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!", "Hey.", "Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.", "Yeah?", "Well, it's my cat.", "Oh yeah, I got a cat.", "You guys this cat is", "like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, \"Rachel!\"", "Well, I was gonna let you play with it.", "(she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!", "I tried! They won't take her back.", "Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?", "No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)", "Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)", "It's not a baby! It's a cat!", "Oh no! No! It's actually\u0097it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?", "Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!", "Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?", "Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.", "Okay, a thousand.", "Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.", "(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?", "It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.", "Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.", "Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)", "Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)", "Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?", "Phoebe, are you okay?", "Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?", "Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.", "No, I meant with the dropper over here.

I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.", "Well, I-I should've told you the truth.", "Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)", "Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.", "Because they're people.", "Yes, but still. They're people\u0085with eyes.", "I-I am not uptight\u0097Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.", "(Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!", "Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!", "Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.)", "Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!", "So, if-if I mess this up, there\u0092s nothing else for dessert?", "Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter\u0092s done?", "Her dancer friends?", "Really?!", "I dunno. Y\u0092know to me he\u0092ll always be \u0093Jack Geller, walks in while you\u0092re changing.\u0094", "(looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn\u0092t it beautiful?", "It\u0092s a truffle. It\u0092s got all of these layers. First there\u0092s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something\u0092s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!", "The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y\u0092know, I thought \u0093well, there\u0092s mincemeat pie,\u0094 I mean that\u0092s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y\u0092know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?", "Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!", "No!", "Yeah?", "(sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it\u0092s so romantic.", "Joey! Come on! I don\u0092t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like \u0093Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?\u0094", "So why don\u0092t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?", "Okay...", "What\u0092s up, Ross?", "Yeah!", "Oh no. No Ross, don\u0092t do this.", "I just- I don\u0092t think us getting back together is a good idea.", "I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y\u0092know? And it\u0092s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.", "No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you\u0092re [pity-tone]", ", alone. And I just-it\u0092s just not the time for us. I\u0092m sorry.", "Joey, you\u0092re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don\u0092t get any dessert.", "No, I\u0092m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it\u0092s trifle time!", "It sure is.", "Beef.", "Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.", "Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!", "Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.", "Well?", "Really? How good?", "Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.", "...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?", "Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?", "(humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!", "(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasn\u0092t supposed to put beef in the trifle!", "You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn\u0092t feel bad!", "That\u0092s a good story, Grandpa.", "So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.", "Well, I used to date him, but you\u0092re still going out with her!", "Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I\u0092m sorry, but I don\u0092t think that was a romantic thing.", "Well, that\u0092s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.", "Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.", "We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.", "Don\u0092t worry, we\u0092re just gonna search here for an hour, them we\u0092re gonna go over to Joey\u0092s and search, OK?", "Chandler, aren\u0092t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?", "Chandler, that\u0092s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you\u0092ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that\u0092s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?", "That\u0092s right!", "Oh, it\u0092s a", "bag!", "We are so gonna find them this year.", "Yeah.", "", "No, we never do that", "Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.", "Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?", "Ha!", "Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!", "Hey, this is hollow.", "This bench, it\u0092s hollow! I can\u0092t believe I never knew that!

Don\u0092t do this to yourself.", "I know.", "Oh-oh,", "! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.", "Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)", "Yeah! It\u0092s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?", "Phoebe hates", "?!", "Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.", "Okay fine! I\u0092ll-I\u0092ll just tell her it\u0092s an antique apothecary table, she doesn\u0092t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.", "Hey!", "Guess!", "Ha! See, I knew, I knew you\u0092d get it on the first guess. Isn\u0092t it cool! It\u0092s an apothecary table.", "Ohh, yes.", "Almost.", "It was only 500 bucks.", "Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y\u0092know like back then.", "Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y\u0092know, it was like a dollar.", "And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.", "Yeah.", "Uh, it\u0092s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y\u0092know?", "Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.", "Hey! We\u0092re here!", "(seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!", "Oh no!", "Ross! Phoebe\u0092s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!", "I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she\u0092s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.", "Because she hates", ".", "I know! I know, she says it\u0092s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on, she\u0092s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?", "Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!", "Ross, get over it! It\u0092s not like she hates you.", "Ross, she\u0092s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.", "Hey!", "Ooh, Phoebe\u0092s here! Okay, let\u0092s turn out all the lights and we\u0092ll just watch the movie!", "He got it a flea market!", "That\u0092s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross\u0092s table.)", "Ohh!!", "Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)", "Oh my God, Phoebe,", "has ripped off the design of our antique!", "Oh yes.", "\u0085see I can\u0092t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.", "I know, I know. I went a little crazy.", "Hey.", "Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.", "Well there\u0092s yore.

I don\u0092t, I don\u0092t think Phoebe really wants to come.", "Oh, she does want to.", "Pheebs, I don\u0092t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, y\u0092know what? Don\u0092t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don\u0092t look at it.

This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.

It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.", "Well y\u0092know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they\u0092re 40, they marry each other.", "Exactly!", "You do?", "Who?", "Joey?!", "Are you serious?!", "Wh\u0085 So\u0085 If neither of you are married by the time you\u0092re 40, you\u0092re gonna marry Joey.", "Oh, seriously?", "Charming.", "Yeah.", "Hey you!", "Oh thank you.

If you and I are both single by the time we\u0092re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we\u0092ve-we\u0092ve already slept together so y\u0092know there\u0092ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean?

And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?", "Pick one.", "You\u0092re welcome.", "(reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.", "Ohhh, this is the least jealous I\u0092ve ever been!", "Oh hell, he\u0092s done this three times! He knows what its about!", "Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago.

Monica, come on!", "No!", "No-no, it\u0092s really not huge.", "Joey, you are not! You\u0092re 31.", "Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look\u0085", "Hey.", "What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn\u0092t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.", "Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!", "I care!", "Y\u0092know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?", "Am I", "to let you watch me undress?", "Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn\u0092t want to talk to anyone, especially me?", "No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?", "What?!", "Monica, what are you talking about?", "Monica, y\u0092know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!", "Oh!!", "Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.", "Ugh, Monica I don\u0092t want to steal your stupid thunder!", "All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain\u0092t gonna happen!", "I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!", "(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?", "Oh wow. That\u0097y\u0092know what? That is so unfair. Y\u0092know what? Now I", "to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let\u0092s go have sex!", "We\u0092re not gonna do this, all right? She\u0092s just gonna think that we\u0092re doin\u0092 it.", "Who is it?", "Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)", "Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?", "All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!", "No you", "know why!", "Because! Because I was sad.", "Look, I am so\u0085so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I\u0092m not. I\u0092m not even close. And I don\u0092t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that\u0092s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!", "Anyway sweetie, I am, I\u0092m", "sorry I ruined your night.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, so let\u0092s get started on the wedding plans!", "Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music\u0085", "Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks\u0085", "Okay.", "Aw.", "What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!", "Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!", "What?!", "Now Joey, what did the duck do?!", "Hey Joey, what \u0091cha doing?", "No.", "Joey, did", "my face cream?", "Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?", "(gasps) You found my book?!", "Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!", "Hey-hey, y\u0092know what? I don\u0092t care! I\u0092m not ashamed of my book. There\u0092s nothing with a woman enjoying a little\u0085erotica. It\u0092s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)", "Well what happened at dinner?", "Wait, but there\u0092s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!", "No, y\u0092know what? It\u0092s gonna be okay. I mean you don\u0092t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y\u0092know? And-and you don\u0092t need, you don\u0092t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)", "Do you even understand what off the rack means?!", "Well what?! How-how much is it?!", "Ohh! (Whispers.)

(Exits.)", "Who are you supposed to be?", "Do you even know what a vicar is?", "(sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it\u0092s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it\u0092s\u0097I\u0092m not\u0097it\u0092s just not funny anymore!", "All right! Y\u0092know what? That\u0092s it! You wanna do it?! Let\u0092s do it!", "(starting to move closer to him) That\u0092s right, I wanna do it with you! I\u0092ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.", "(moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I\u0092ve been waitin\u0092 so long to get on that body!", "Yeah that\u0092s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!", "Oh, come on now, don\u0092t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off!

They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm\u0085", "Yes!", "Oh, y\u0092know what you should get \u0091em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.", "Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.", "Y\u0092know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.", "Yeah! I\u0092ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.", "What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.", "That", "the Coast Guard.", "Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We\u0092re not finished with the lesson yet.", "Okay, I\u0092m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?", "Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let\u0092s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what\u0092s this called?", "Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?", "No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?", "Time\u0092s up, now your dead.", "Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)", "Don\u0092t just say yes! This isn\u0092t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!", "(laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.", "I don\u0092t know. Y\u0092know, they didn\u0092t get us anything.", "Well hello! So, when are we gettin\u0092 back out on the water matey?", "Why not?", "What? I was just trying to teach you.", "Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn\u0092t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.", "Look Joey, I\u0092m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.", "Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?", "Yeah, I didn\u0092t want you to get hit by the boom!", "All right, y\u0092know what? I-I\u0092m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.", "I won\u0092t boss you around.", "And, I\u0092ll be nice.", "And\u0097Joey!", "Okay Joey honey, you\u0092re doing really good! All right, now I\u0092m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?", "Right?", "It\u0092s left sweetie, but that\u0092s okay sweetie, that\u0092s a tough one.", "Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!", "(yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)", "No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.", "Okay Joey, we\u0092re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)", "Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)", "(angrily) No! All right?! I did", "see the bird! I did", "see the fish! I did", "see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did", ", because I was trying to teach you", "to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!", "What do you mean you quit?!

(Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don\u0092t quit?!", "No! No! No! I\u0092m not yelling at you, I\u0092m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I\u0092m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I\u0092ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin\u0092. Oh, Joey, I\u0092m sorry. I\u0092m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.", "Really?", "Awww\u0085", "Left.", "Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.", "Ohh we\u0092re not sailing.", "All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what\u0092s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!", "(hands him one) Here you go.", "Oh wow!

I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.", "Aw, thanks!", "What?!", "Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I\u0092ve heard that before.)", "No! Y\u0092know what? No!

And-and y\u0092know I was thinking about it, if-if you\u0092re Monica\u0092s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.", "Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y\u0092know just in case\u0085", "Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was", ". Oh and here\u0092s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y\u0092know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.", "And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y\u0092know \u0091cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I\u0092m just gonna grab a couple of these.", "Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica\u0092s something borrowed and it\u0092s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah\u0085", "You do? Why?", "But Pheebs, y\u0092know you earned it.", "No, I was ten. I just developed early.", "Hey!", "Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she\u0092s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)", "Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?", "Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)", "What-what?! You\u0092re gonna leave this person with me?!", "Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!", "Y\u0092know what? That\u0092s a lot to remember, can\u0092t I just tell her you\u0092re a pig?", "Well forget it, I\u0092m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.", "Hi.", "Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.", "Hi.", "(pause) Would you like some pancakes?", "Phoebe and", "Hey!", "Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!", "I know!", "Oh and I\u0092ll call ya too!", "Bye!", "Oh Joey, I\u0092m sorry I just couldn\u0092t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y\u0092know we got to talking and I\u0085", "Cupid.", "Look Joey, come on she\u0092s so perfect for you! I mean she\u0092s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.", "Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.", "Fine. (They start to walk away.)", "Phoebe!", "I\u0092m sorry?", "Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?", "Yeah, there was. It was\u0097there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read\u0097Yes, there was.", "Well now what\u0092s the rush?", "Well look who\u0092s here!", "Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!", "Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.", "Phoebe and", "A birthday party.", "Phoebe and", "Allison\u0092s birthday party.", "Phoebe and", "32. (Joey\u0092s not buying it.)", "(does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don\u0092t you guys do something?!", "How did it go with Erin?", "(gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin\u0092 about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don\u0092t get married before I do.", "So how\u0092s it goin\u0092 with Joey?", "Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.", "But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!", "Ugh, tramp!", "Yeah, see ya.", "Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.", "Hi!", "Phoebe and", "Oh no, yeah.", "Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she\u0092s not lookin\u0092 for a serious relationship.", "Well, she told me. She said she\u0092s kinda a loner.", "Joey\u0085", "Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell \u0091em you\u0092re not looking for a relationship.", "Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?", "Do you want some pancakes?", "All right, I got 48.", "(counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?", "Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.", "Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.", "Seriously, it's moving!", "(gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?", "Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?", "Oh, I'm sorry.", "Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?", "Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?", "When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?", "Interesting.", "Huh. A moo-point?", "(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?", "You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.", "Hey!", "How are you holding up?", "Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.", "So were you guys together a long time?", "Now that she broke up with you?", "Yeah. Hmmmm.", "No\u0085Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it\u0085it has to work out.", "Because, uh\u0097it has to.", "Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.", "Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)", "Uh, yeah, well, see, he\u0085 Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and\u0085you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!", "No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.", "Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.", "What?", "Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?", "(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and they\u0092re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)", "Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out", "(gasps) Hi!", "(uncovers the dog) Hi!", "Oh, hi! How are you doing?", "Oh.", "Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.", "Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It\u0097y\u0092know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?", "day Monday", "to do. So, we're okay?", "Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.", "Really?", "Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.", "(entering, happily) Gooood morning!!", "Well, why shouldn\u0092t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!", "Come on, it\u0092s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.", "(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We\u0085 We are not\u0085 \u0085going to let it\u0085 be a problem.", "Well y\u0092know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)", "Oh Monica come on, y\u0092know I don\u0092t sleep with guys on the first date!", "Anymore!!", "Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?", "Okay, thank you. That\u0092ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)", "Okay, you hard worker! I\u0092ll remember to put that in your evaluation.", "Well, you\u0092ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y\u0092know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)", "No, I\u0092ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?", "(hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?", "(worried) Okay please, you\u0092re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!", "I\u0092m thinkin\u0092 no.", "Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.", "Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, \"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,\" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, \"Dear God, I hope not,\" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.", "Maybe it\u0092s not as bad as I think. Y\u0092know, maybe they didn\u0092t take it the way I meant it.", "Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!", "Yeah?", "Oh my God! Joey!", "Ugh!", "Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we\u0092re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner\u0092s office. Now, he doesn\u0092t get in until 10, so he\u0092s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.", "Yeah, well Betty\u0092s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,", "get in the office.", "Let\u0092s roll!", "(worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything\u0097minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)", "Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)", "(laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.", "Well\u0085", "Oh no-no-no\u0085", "You\u0092re lookin\u0092 at it upside down\u0097y\u0092know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn\u0092t matter.", "Whoa! I can\u0092t believe you did that. That was really sweet.", "No, you could\u0092ve lost your job.", "Thank you! You\u0092re great! (They kiss.)", "What?", "I\u0085 It just\u0097it took me so long to get that desk organized.", "(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)", "(freaking out) Oh my god!!", "You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.", "(to Monica) Did you know he was in there?", "(entering) Hey!", "Drums?", "(stopping at Phoebe\u0092s entrance) Ha!", "Joey, y\u0092know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.", "What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?", "Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.", "What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?", "And that makes you angry because\u0085", "Where did you get that?", "Phoebe?", "Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!", "It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.", "Oh, it's so much more fun with you.", "We did!", "Oh, I would love to!", "Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)", "(with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!", "Oh wow! Look at this place!", "(yelling from another room) Oh my God!", "(returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?", "And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?", "Do you really not know where I\u0092m going with this? (Phoebe nods, \"No.\") It left! It\u0092s one huge room!", "See?", "You can\u0092t, because of the new skylight!", "So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?", "Oh yeah? Startin\u0092 to feel her again there are we?", "Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?", "Phoebe, it\u0092s okay. I like living with Joey.", "Oh please, I hate packing, it\u0092s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I\u0092m really gonna miss living with you.", "I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I\u0092m gettin\u0092 something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?", "(entering with Phoebe) Hey!", "(seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny\u0092s funeral in here.", "Oh.", "I got it!", "Its back in cage!", "Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!", "(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.", "Oh, y\u0092know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I\u0097(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)\u0097Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)", "Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.", "Why, why not?", "Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.", "(taking a bite) Oh, I\u0092m sorry what?", "Umm, I think he\u0092s still out. What\u0092s wrong?", "(reading the note) \"Pheebs, can\u0092t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy.\" (Laughs) Big Daddy?", "Hi!", "So just bring it back downstairs, what\u0092s the problem?", "Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?", "It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling\u0085 (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!", "Yeah and we\u0092ll drop it off downstairs so that we\u0092re not tempted.", "Momma\u0092s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the cheesecake.)", "What? Wait a minute, I didn\u0092t pay, I thought you paid!", "(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)", "She could be out of town. Maybe she\u0092ll be gone for months.", "No that could kill her.", "No so we\u0092re protecting her.", "But we should move quick.", "Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.", "(taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!", "Hey!", "Oh it\u0092s umm, it\u0092s tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)", "(with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)", "Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!", "What?! What?!", "Wait a minute!", "Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don\u0092t!", "You think I trust you with it?! No! We\u0092re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!", "What? Oh, well then y\u0092know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.", "Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.", "Oh for God sake just pick a piece!", "That\u0092s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don\u0092t come crying to me if", "eat your piece to fast. (As she\u0092s saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!", "Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.", "Oh! Yay! Look! There\u0092s a piece that doesn\u0092t have floor on it!", "Hey, come on now!", "No. No, you can\u0092t.", "Oh I don\u0092t-I don\u0092t know.", "Yeah actually, I think we\u0092re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.", "Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.", "Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)", "You wanna go in the bedroom? It\u0092s a little more comfortable.", "Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?", "No seriously, y\u0092know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?", "Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don\u0092t get.", "Y\u0092know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Tag! I\u0092m serious! This isn\u0092t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!", "Yes I did! And I put a little", "on it that said, \"Must go out today,\" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn\u0092t want to seem to bossy.", "Y\u0092know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.", "Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!", "No! Come on its late, we\u0092re not gonna go down to the office.", "Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!", "Oh", "can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I\u0092m talking about! You have to be organized! You\u0092ve got newspapers! You\u0092ve got magazines! You got\u0097Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.", "Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y\u0092know what, the", "is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)", "In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a", "on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the", "on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said, \"Must go out today.\" So you just keep looking in there! All right?", "Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don\u0092t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?", "I don\u0092t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It\u0092s not a perfect world! Just go please.", "Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don\u0092t get it.", "Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh\u0085 (She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) \u0085fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?", "Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check", "the drawers!", "Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no it\u0092s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn\u0092t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)", "(thinks) Y\u0092know, I don\u0092t-I don\u0092t know. Let me, let me check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)", "Can I see you in my office for a minute?", "You put these on my desk!", "Oh really? So you\u0092re saying they just", "out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think", "should have a line here.)", "(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.", "Hey.", "Well, y\u0092know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.", "So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.", "And your", "does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.", "No?", "I\u0092m sorry, Rosita? As in\u0085", "Joey, it\u0092s just a chair! What\u0092s the big deal?", "Stevie the TV?", "No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!", "Joey, Joey I am so sorry.", "Okay, come on\u0097Joey, I\u0092ll buy you a new one! All right? We\u0092ll go down to the store right now and we\u0092ll-we\u0092ll get you a new chair.", "But don\u0092t you think Rosita would\u0092ve wanted you to move on? I mean y\u0092know, she did always put\u0085your comfort first.", "(grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?", "You will like it!", "You don\u0092t even know!", "Well look, if you don\u0092t like this\u0085(The audience\u0092s laughter at Chandler\u0092s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel\u0092s line.)", "Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y\u0092know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.", "Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y\u0092know, start the heeling process?", "That\u0092s weird.", "It\u0092s not a miracle Joey! I\u0092m sure there\u0092s some explanation.", "Joey, I really don\u0092t\u0085", "Well no.", "No, y\u0092know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!", "That\u0092s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in the chair.)", "(grabbing a beer out of the chair\u0092s fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!", "Hey, how\u0092s\u0085how\u0092s the uh, miracle chair?", "Yeah? Wow! Y\u0092know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!", "Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV", "you get radio!", "Hey Chandler!", "How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?", "Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?", "I just purchased the", ". (Which is an actual product by the way, I\u0092m not sure about the 3000 part.)", "Well, it\u0092s a long story, but umm I broke Joey\u0092s chair\u0085", "Yeah.", "Ohhhhh. That\u0092s how it got fixed!", "Noo! (Laughs) Angels.", "What? Wh-hey!", "Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!", "No Joe, no miracle.", "Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don\u0092t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!", "No-no-no! This chair\u0092s not going anywhere.", "The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!", "We\u0092re the Cobras!", "Ahhhh\u0085.", "Uh-huh.", "Hey!", "Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.", "Good ones?", "Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?", "Y\u0092know, I\u0092m still 29 in Guam.", "Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?", "Look, y\u0092know I know my life\u0092s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who\u0092ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they\u0092re thirty.", "There you go!", "Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!", "Nothing. I don\u0092t want to do anything.", "Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know it\u0092s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.", "Y\u0092know what? I am going to do something today. I\u0092m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I\u0092m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.", "So what?! Y\u0092know what? The way I see it\u0097(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)\u0097Ow! Son of a bitch!!", "(glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment.", "(entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She\u0092s coming!", "What\u0092s-what\u0092s going on? Phil\u0092s really pissed!", "Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.", "Ahh!", "(opening it) A scooter! (She\u0092s not happy.)", "No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)", "Okay.", "Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It\u0092s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That\u0092s funny, yeah!", "(crying) No, I know! I get it! It\u0092s funny!", "No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don\u0092t have any of those things. That\u0092s why it\u0092s so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)", "Well, I feel fine, but I think you\u0092re bumming out the rest of the kids.", "Okay! Y\u0092know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids\u0085", "As I was saying\u0085 I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I\u0092m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan!

That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it\u0092s not legal. Okay? They-they don\u0092t have a marriage license, they don\u0092t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!", "You\u0092re supposed to realize that they are adults!

A little help here!", "Joey, just because they\u0092re not getting married doesn\u0092t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!", "Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don\u0092t you tell us a little bit about your band?", "(To Dina) Really?

Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y\u0092know who I\u0092m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers\u0085 (Stops when she realizes it was her.)", "Yes, you are.", "Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?", "Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?", "Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!", "No. I\u0092m very comfortable.", "No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!", "Well would you like me to lie down on the table?", "Do you feel it too?", "Hi.", "Well, let\u0092s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.", "Okay, even this is turning me on!", "Oh hey! Hey Ross!

Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very", ". (Joey enters.) I\u0092ll call you back.", "It\u0092s just the pizza place.", "I\u0092m sorry honey, I\u0092m just having a, having a rough day.", "Oh you really, you really just don\u0092t want to hear about it.", "Okay, it\u0092s just\u0097and this is really embarrassing\u0097but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I\u0092m just finding myself\u0085how do I put this umm, erotically charged.", "Yeah. So y\u0092know, I have all of these feelings and I don\u0092t know what to do about them, because I can\u0092t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don\u0092t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y\u0092know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he\u0092s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so\u0085hard\u0085to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?", "Well, I gotta get up early and it\u0092s almost seven o\u0092clock.", "Okay, good night!", "(entering) I didn\u0092t ask you to do it!", "You\u0092re Joey!", "Right back at ya!", "And so bad.

Good night!", "They made you head of the department!", "Yeah.", "Uh, Paul\u0092s Caf\ufffd. They got great food and it\u0092s really romantic.", "Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the", "for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing\u0097Oh! Take her dancing!", "Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin\u0092 all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I\u0092m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it\u0092s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.", "Huh?", "What?! Joey, you don\u0092t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.", "(interrupting) Okay! I\u0092ll go with ya! I\u0092ll go! I\u0092ll go with ya.", "All right?", "Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?", "Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they\u0092re my favorite. Thank you.", "Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I\u0092m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I\u0092m wearing underwear that goes up to about\u0085(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)\u0085there.", "Yeah, actually that\u0092s my roommate\u0092s.", "Ah yes, but he\u0092s very protective of me so you\u0092d better watch yourself.", "Hm-mmm.", "(laughs) Yeah, but I\u0092m pretty sure he\u0092s gay.", "Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?", "Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?", "Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date\u0097Oh, I almost forgot. I didn\u0092t pay you the rent check.", "Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?", "I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.", "Oh my God. And that works?!", "Oh, you poor little famous man.", "(looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!", "Alright. So where\u0092d you grow up?", "Come on, just answer the question!", "And so were-were you close to your parents?", "Why not?", "(sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It\u0092s gotta be rough.", "Huh?", "Thank you! And now if you\u0092ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.", "And now you\u0092re watching me walk away.", "I am not gonna answer that!", "No one! They are my friends, I wouldn\u0092t punch any of them.", "Yeah, but I don\u0092t know why. Look at me, I\u0092m having such a wonderful time!", "I know!", "Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.", "Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.", "All right, now don\u0092t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I\u0092m ripping into this swan.", "So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani\u0092s end of the night moves?", "How do you do that?", "Oh my God!", "No, I don\u0092t want to tell you.", "Because it\u0092s embarrassing.", "(laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we\u0092re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, \"Hmmm.\" Okay, I know it doesn\u0092t sound like anything, but I swear it works.", "All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.", "\u0085you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!", "Well, why didn\u0092t you just take a cab?", "Well you\u0092re not gonna be able to keep doing this.", "You what?", "Right. Wow!", "Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie", "?", "Relax! It\u0092s not like it\u0092s", "!", "Yeah I know it\u0092s really boring, but it\u0092s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting", "sometime.", "Well don\u0092t you have that big date tonight?", "Hey Joey, can I ask you something?", "After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?", "I don\u0092t know! (Pause) I\u0092m-I\u0092m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster\u0085", "Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.", "Really?! How come we didn\u0092t cross paths?", "Oh God! Thank God you\u0092re home! I\u0092m watching", ".", "Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!", "No! No! Seriously, what\u0092s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?", "Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?", "Y\u0092know, I never thought I\u0092d say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies.

Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren\u0092t you scared?", "Oh Joey, I\u0092m so happy things worked out for us that we\u0092re having this baby together. I love you so much.", "And I hope it\u0092s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you\u0092re the best sex I ever had.", "(bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!", "Come feel this! Come feel my belly!", "Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!", "Yes!", "Oh, okay!

(Joey and Chandler clap their hands)", "Hello.", "Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.", "Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...", "No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.", "Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.", "I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!", "Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.", "Oh yeah, I'm jealous. \"Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass\". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.", "That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.", "It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.", "Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!", "Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?", "(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.", "Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.", "Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)", "Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.", "If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?", "Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you \"momma's boy\", starting right now.", "Hi!", "Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.", "Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.", "Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!", "I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?", "Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!", "Shh!", "(to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.", "God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.", "What?", "Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.", "Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys see in her?", "Yeah, sure!", "Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)", "Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?", "Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?", "whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?", "Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?", "Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.", "Mmm hmm.", "No.", "Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...", "Oh, you bought me a present! Why?", "Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). \"From Gavin\"", "(opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.", "See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?", "Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.", "You do?", "See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)", "Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.", "Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.", "Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...", "Bye!", "Hey!", "You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?", "I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.", "Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.", "Why? What's the big deal?", "What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.", "So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?", "Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!", "Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.", "Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.", "What?", "Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.", "Really? What's that like?", "Really?", "Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!", "This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?", "I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!", "He's not stoned.", "Yeah, four times.", "No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.", "Don't touch my coat!", "Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?", "Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!", "No.", "What? What do you mean, \"there you are\"? Where was she?", "Well, uh...", "Really, really not.", "All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.", "I just had a rough night.", "Eww!", "Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...", "Yeah.", "Oh.", "Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?", "Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.", "Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.", "Hey! How was basketball?", "Oh, no! Who did that?", "She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?", "Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!", "All right... Oh, Emma loves him!", "(threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!", "What are you doing?", "Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.", "Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.", "Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.", "Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...", "Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?", "Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.", "Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.", "Joey, come on!", "I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?", "Original.", "Then what's that big lump under your covers?", "That's not Monica!", "(to herself) Oh God.", "(yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!", "Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.", "Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).", "Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!", "Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?", "I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.", "Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!", "(excited) Are you serious?", "Hey, that was an honest mistake!", "Yeah, that was an awesome day!", "Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?", "Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so", "!", "Oh, in my head he's done some pretty \"not-gay-stuff\"!", "Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?", "Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!

Well, that's new!", "Can I ask you a question?", "Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?", "Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.", "Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.", "I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.", "Olivia.", "So do you think that my dream means anything?", "Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...", "You took the same class twice.", "Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...", "Ok, we're still on that.", "Hey!", "Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?", "(looks puzzled) How...how...?", "uh-huh", "(to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...", "What...how is it going with Drake?", "What...that scene I saw was so good!", "Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?", "So?", "Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?", "Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?", "(shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.", "(looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...", "(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.", "Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?", "Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?", "No reason.", "Yeah", "(with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!", "(giggling and whispering) Maybe.", "(whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with \"because\") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.", "Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!", "Ok, off the top of my head...

Anybody know a good tailor?", "No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.", "Okay.\u00a0 You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!", "Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.", "What stupid thing did you do?", "People do stupid things when they're upset.", "Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.", "Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?", "At least as long as I have the pants.", "(entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!", "Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.", "Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...", "Cupping.", "Come on, Monica, things could be worse.

That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.", "What did you just do?", "What did you just do?", "Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.", "Howdy.", "Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.", "(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.", "(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?", "You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of.

I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.", "Because the kids need new shoes.", "Do I look fat?", "Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.", "Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....", "Okay, so you both just know this stuff?", "That's easy, baggage claim.", "Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.", "Thank you Rachel.", "Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.", "Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)", "Yeah.", "Okay, the old hug and roll.", "Okay, one question.", "You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?", "Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.", "Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam.

(phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.", "Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.", "Noo.", "No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'", "I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.", "Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!", "Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?", "You think?", "Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.", "'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.

We should take a trip.", "Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!", "I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.", "It doesn't scare me!", "Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)", "So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.", "Then I got all needy and clingy.", "She said she'd call me.", "Oh God.", "This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.", "So, you don't think I'm terminal?", "Okay, okay. So, should I call her?", "So I'm not, not gonna lose her?", "I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'", "(in a British accent) Hello, Janice.", "(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?", "(normal voice) No. Not anymore.", "Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.

I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.", "Look, when I\u0092ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I\u0092m sorry.", "Why can\u0092t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.", "It\u0092s gotta be the first one.", "Yep, I\u0092m in a tree.", "Well, that\u0092s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I\u0092ll be in Cuba.", "What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?", "(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?", "I\u0092m here to see Mary-Angela.", "Where\u0092s Mary-Angela?", "This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?", "Well, it\u0092s, it\u0092s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?", "So um, Mary-Angela, what\u0092s your second favorite?", "Would you just please....give me the receipt \u0091cause this is great. It\u0092s top notch.", "So will I.", "Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn\u0092t mean anything.", "Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)", "(startled) Hey!", "Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I\u0092m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.", "Ahhhh, you\u0092re not Mary-Angela.", "This is so bad. If-if you\u0092re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?", "Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn\u0092t see Mary-Angela)", "No Joey! No Joey! Don\u0092t Joey! Joey!", "(pats him on the shoulder) You\u0092re it! Now run and hide!", "I wasn\u0092t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey\u0092s sisters gasp) Look, I\u0092m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.", "Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother\u0092s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?", "Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you\u0092re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.", "Okay, absolutely!", "You\u0092ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister\u0092s, but he still doesn\u0092t know which one is Mary-Angela.)", "What?! (Cookie punches him)", "Don\u0092t worry.", "Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.", "All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?", "I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.", "Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?", "(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.", "(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?", "Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.", "Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.", "Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.", "I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.", "I'll get you the Cliff Notes.", "The abridgment.", "....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!", "Oh no, no, no, no.", "All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?", "Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.", "To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.", "Bye-bye.", "What, what, what?!", "You really think that is what he meant?", "Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.", "Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.", "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'", "He paints quite a picture doesn't he?", "Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?", "And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)", "Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.", "Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?", "Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)", "Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.", "Yeah, baby!", "Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?", "Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she\u0092s celebrating that by going on a date with him.", "Oh, hey.", "(to Robert) So ah, isn\u0092t a bit cold out for shorts?", "Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.", "(standing up) I\u0092m up! I\u0092m up, I\u0092ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?", "Okay Ross, why don\u0092t you come with me?", "Robert\u0092s coming out.", "No. He.....he\u0092s coming out of his shorts.", "The man is showing brain.", "(to Ross) Wellll?", "What do we do? What do we do?", "Like an eclipse.", "Your liking it, huh?", "No, actually Laurie\u0092s a boy.", "Hey.", "You mean a three pointer?", "I\u0092m sorry, I\u0092m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn\u0092t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.", "Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!", "Hmmm, that\u0092s very cool.", "I can\u0092t believe she cracked your code!", "No, Beth doesn\u0092t die, she doesn\u0092t die. Does she Rachel?", "We can\u0092t tell him, you can\u0092t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.", "Yeah, we got, um-hmm.", "I like her.", "Well, that\u0092s pretty much all I\u0092m looking for from these people.", "(to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I\u0092d like know whether that\u0092s several big fish or just one big fish.", "No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called \u0091wait until the last moment before I burst and die.\u0092", "Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it\u0092s a beautiful woman coming out of the men\u0092s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?", "(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I\u0092m-I\u0092m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.", "Ginger. I\u0092m talking to Ginger, so....", "Nope, nope, I\u0092d just ah, I\u0092d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)", "Well, that\u0092s the best kiss I\u0092ve had with anyone I\u0092ve ever met in a men\u0092s room.", "(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.", "Yeah, we\u0092re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.", "No, really you\u0092re gonna freeze.", "You\u0092re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?", "Hey.", "Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.", "Great. It was great. She\u0092s ah, she\u0092s great, great looking, great personality, she\u0092s greatness.", "Joey told you about the leg, huh?", "Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn\u0092t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don\u0092t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it\u0092s like \u0091Hey, y'know what, where\u0092s your leg?\u0092 I mean I\u0092m the smallest person in the world aren\u0092t I? I\u0092m the smallest person in the world.", "(to Monica) Actually he\u0092s the smallest person in the world.", "It came up.", "No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?", "No. No. I don\u0092t think so.", "That\u0092s-that\u0092s my nubbin.", "It\u0092s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.", "Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?", "You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?", "(entering, happily) Well hello!", "The doctor.", "Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.", "That was an obvious joke, and I didn\u0092t think of it. Why didn\u0092t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!", "(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I\u0092m going down to the Xerox place.", "Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.", "Yeah! You wanna come?", "Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!", "Uh-oh.", "(to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.", "Well ah, ........y'know.", "All right, rock on. (Does the \u0091Hang 10\u0092 sign, then hides his face in shame.)", "Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?", "What time is it now?", "Yeah all right, so we\u0092ll hang out.", "Yes. Vividly.", "Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...", "Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?", "She was kidding.", "She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.", "Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)", "Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.", "Well it you don\u0092t know that, then I don\u0092t want to do this with you.", "And that\u0092s the only colour that comes in.", "So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.", "Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.", "Hey, this isn\u0092t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!", "Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.", "Why? What happened to him?", "Oh my God! Oh my God!", "Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?", "He\u0092s right. Nobody\u0092s gonna benefit, and you\u0092re just gonna hurt her.", "All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing\u0092s right. And that\u0092s what deathbeds are for.", "Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac\u0092s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe\u0092s friends with Rachel. And that\u0092s the trail, I did it!", "Off?!!", "Yeah, well I don\u0092t think you can make that statement, unless you\u0092ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.", "Oh, that\u0092s mature.", "Nothing, nothing.", "Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....", "(to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.", "Uh-oh.", "She was not good. Not good.", "Uh-oh.", "Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.", "Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.", "(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we\u0092re never leaving, ever.", "Oh great, food with hair on it.", "Because", "would be crazy?", "Yeah, come on, it\u0092s Ross and Rachel, they\u0092ve got too.", "What?", "Are you actually saying these words?", "Let\u0092s go.", "(to Joey) Is that your new walk?", "This is the", ".", "We are. He\u0092s meeting us here.", "Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.", "Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn\u0092t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.", "Y'know what maybe it\u0092s gonna be okay, I mean it\u0092s been a week.", "No.", "Yes, yes, it\u0092s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.", "Yeah, he\u0092s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.", "(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!", "Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I\u0092m, I\u0092m smoking still.", "Look, I\u0092m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.", "Yeahhh. I\u0092m tellin\u0092 ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....", "Oh that\u0092s great, with my luck, that\u0092s gonna be him.", "Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it\u0092s Rachel again.)", "Hey, shut up!! You\u0092re not my real Mom!!", "Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.", "Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.", "(to Joey) Well he\u0092s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.", "What?", "Beam me up Jesus.", "Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.", "Oh, come on, there\u0092s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.", "Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.", "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!", "(to Joey) My lighter\u0092s in there! (points to the cab)", "Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe\u0092s not hot enough to light this!", "Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.", "Ladies, ladies, let\u0092s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica\u0092s bra.", "Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.", "Okay, now let\u0092s decide who has the nicest ass.", "At least let me smoke it to the good part.", "I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)", "Well it\u0092s very unsettling.", "Oh no, now it\u0092s not gonna make any sense!", "Oh, this is horrible, it\u0092s just horrible.", "It\u0092s horrible.", "Y'know what, I can handle it, handle\u0092s my middle name. Actually it\u0092s the ah, middle part of my first name.", "Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)", "I was being Shelly Winters from", ".", "Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.", "Okay.", "No-no, why don\u0092t you hang on to that one.", "Okay, that\u0092s like the least fun game ever.", "Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)", "Or what my Father called Thursday night.", "Y'know, I would\u0092ve bet good money that he\u0092d be the first one of us to get married.", "Always illegal Joe.", "If that doesn\u0092t keep kids in school, what will?", "(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.", "Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?", "Y'know what, pretty good.", "Good! I haven\u0092t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.", "Thanks", "What check thing?", "(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete\u0085 (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?", "Who\u0092s he huggin\u0092?", "This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!", "There you go!!", "(to the girls who are staring at him) What?", "(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)", "Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.", "Okay, then get the lobster!", "Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.", "Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from", "?", "Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?", "Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.", "It\u0092s possible. You are very loveable, I\u0092d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.", "(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I\u0092d miss you.", "And you\u0092re our age. You\u0092re our age.", "That\u0092s not a state Joe.", "You\u0092re our age!", "I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn\u0092t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It\u0092s so annoying. Does it bug you?", "Is there any chance you didn\u0092t see that?", "Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can\u0092t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You\u0092re gonna get peep eye!", "You didn\u0092t just break up.", "You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!", "Okay.", "And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.", "Stop what?!", "No!! You can\u0092t!!", "I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!", "Look man!", "Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)", "She\u0092s moving on! Okay, if it\u0092s not this guy, it\u0092s gonna be somebody else! And unless you\u0092re thinking about subletting my peep hole,", "are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It\u0092s over.", "Okay.", "I know. (He rubs Ross\u0092s head)", "I don\u0092t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)", "(to Joey) I wasn\u0092t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?", "Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.", "I think somebody has a crush on somebody.", "I\u0092m talking about you. You big, big freak.", "Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you\u0092d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!", "\u0091Cause it\u0092s-it\u0092s not his last name.", "No, it\u0092s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He\u0092s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there\u0092s no Gold Man.", "So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?", "What about things that are already gold?", "Okay, let\u0092s play my game now.", "Wait a minute, wait. You\u0092re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn\u0092t want you back?!", "My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.", "Hey.", "Oh, that\u0092s-that\u0092s okay, no problem.

Dug my action, did she? Checkin\u0092 out the Chan-Chan man!", "Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I\u0092ll do it.", "(entering) Hey, my Father\u0092s house does that!", "Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there\u0092s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.", "Of course, I didn\u0092t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna\u0092s such a", "!", "(entering with Rachel) I\u0092m telling ya, Joanna\u0092s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, \u0091This was fun. Let\u0092s do it again sometime. I\u0092ll give you a call.\u0092", "That\u0092s what you say at the end of a date.", "To her face? Look it\u0092s the end of the date, I\u0092m standing there, I know all she\u0092s waiting for is for me to say \u0091I\u0092ll call her\u0092 and it\u0092s just y'know, comes out. I can\u0092t help it, it\u0092s a compulsion.", "Multiple, so many paper cuts.", "(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.", "Look, you can\u0092t call somebody after this long just to say, \u0091In case you didn\u0092t notice, I don\u0092t like you!\u0092", "Nooo!!

It\u0092s, just it\u0092s right here, (points to his eye) and it\u0092s all the time.", "(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.", "The food there was, was great.", "So take care.", "Well, this was great. I\u0092ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)", "Noo!", "Look, I\u0092m sorry. Okay? I\u0092m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.", "Ahhhh\u0097I\u0092m not going to call you.", "I\u0092m sorry. I\u0092m-I\u0092m-I\u0092m sorry that I said I was going to when I\u0092m not.

I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I\u0092m really sorry, it\u0092s just that this is not, this isn\u0092t going to work out.", "Yeah, o-okay.", "Well this is great! I\u0092ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!", "(sporting a goatee) Hey.", "Oh, so that\u0092s why the priest threw holy water on me. (there\u0092s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen,", "have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.", "Hey.", "No way!", "Oh my God! Who\u0092s gonna watch that?!", "Yeah. (they start to leave)", "Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)", "So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.", "Okay, so I guess that\u0092s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.", "Hey!", "Okay. (He opens it and it\u0092s a baby chick) It\u0092s a chicken.", "Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.", "Easy Lenny.", "Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.", "Hey.", "She?", "I don\u0092t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can\u0092t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.", "Excuse me?", "I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!", "You don\u0092t think I get up when you get up?", "Yes, here it comes! I\u0092m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don\u0092t think so mister!", "And you don\u0092t think taking care of our chick is work?", "I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick, we\u0092ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?", "I\u0092ll take her back tomorrow.", "Hey!", "(rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!", "I know. See, yes. That\u0092s Yasmine Bleeth, she\u0092s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.", "Hey!", "I did! But the store wouldn\u0092t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?", "If they can\u0092t find a home for her, they kill her! And I\u0092m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!", "Okay. And it\u0092s not just chicks y'know? It\u0092s all kinds of other animals!", "Thanks, I\u0092m glad you see it that way.", "Ohhh-hoo, funny story!", "Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!", "That\u0092s a bad duck!!!

You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.", "Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.", "Well sensitive is important, pick him.", "(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.", "So, what do you thing the good news is?", "Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He\u0092s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that\u0092s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.", "Oh, so you\u0092re going with the teacher, huh?", "(comforting the duck) Everything\u0092s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?", "Do you think that there\u0092s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you\u0092re driving into town there\u0092s-there\u0092s like a sign, and it says \u0093You\u0092re in Sample.\u0094 (He says it like urine sample.)", "Yeah, it\u0092s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: \u0093They\u0092re", "no rules.\u0094", "Yes, but there\u0092s two in martini, soo everybody", "to my office.", "Oh it\u0092s Bing, sir.

Which one\u0092s my turkey burger?", "Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it\u0092s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I\u0092m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.", "Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!", "No, I ah, I didn\u0092t do them.", "No, no I just ah, didn\u0092t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don\u0092t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.", "Doug!!", "I\u0092m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.", "No, no. It-it\u0092s not about the swearing, it\u0092s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.", "Oh, and don\u0092t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It\u0092s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it\u0092s making all the other guys jealous.", "Okay. (he starts to leave)", "Ahhhhh!

First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy!

I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.", "I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!", "Really?!", "(laughs) Right in there!", "99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.", "Hey!", "Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.", "Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.", "You-you do?", "You got me.", "Yeah. Right.", "Okay.", "Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.", "Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.", "Uhh, no-no thanks.", "Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)", "What?", "Hey, look, what do you want from me?", "I am pretending.", "Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!", "Can I sleep on your couch?", "(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!", "It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it\u0092s bad enough that I\u0092m in love with my roommates girlfriend\u0097which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we\u0092re in the room together there\u0092s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I\u0092ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she\u0092s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)", "(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?", "Goin\u0092 out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn\u0092t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.", "(shocked) What?", "Wait! You\u0092re going out with Kathy!", "Well, I\u0092m upset\u0097for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can\u0092t believe he just sad that.)", "Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she\u0092s-she\u0092s smart, and funny, and gets you.", "All right look, I think it\u0092s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.", "All right! Bring it on, you\u0085", "(interrupting) Oh my God!

He\u0092s running a little late, he says he\u0092s sorry.", "So I guess it\u0092s just uh, you and me then.", "Yeah, I think it is!", "Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut\u0085", "\u0085and then it got canceled.", "Really?! You do that?", "Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don\u0092t make my tail too poofy.", "Well, thanks. I grow it myself.

(He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)", "Well, y\u0092know I\u0092m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.", "Oh, I don\u0092t know.", "You mean with Casey.", "Or Casey.", "Could be Casey.", "Consider Casey.", "That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!", "I kissed Kathy.", "No. Is there anyway,", "you think he\u0092ll understand this?", "Oh, don\u0092t say that!

No! No! I just kissed her.", "How is that worse?!", "Look, I\u0092m sorry! But there\u0092s nothing I can do, I think I\u0092m in love with her!", "You\u0092re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.", "Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!", "Probably because\u0085", "(on phone) Hey, it\u0092s me. I know you can\u0092t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I\u0092d try and apologize over the phone.

Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?", "Oh that\u0092s not true! That\u0092s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it\u0085 (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe\u0092s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it\u0085 (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials\u0085", "Op, y'know what though, it\u0092s kind\u0092ve a girlie briefcase.", "Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!", "Thanks.", "Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.", "Well maybe you should put some ice on it.", "He\u0092s really picky about his patients.", "(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.", "Oh y\u0092know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.", "I don\u0092t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.", "Oh no-no-no, you don\u0092t want to do that, then you\u0092re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.", "Like?", "When was the last time you saw her wear it?", "Big dog?", "I walk into a room and he won\u0092t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian.

Okay, they have had a", "difficult year! What with the robbery and all!", "What?", "All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?", "(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.", "The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!", "Air hole! Air hole!!

Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.", "Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.", "Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)", "(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.", "Oh the humanity.", "More so than anything else.", "Almost over man.", "Why am I looking?", "You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.", "(singing)", "!", "!", "(To Monica) Hey!", "You ready?", "You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.", "Let me see the earrings.", "(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?", "(To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.", "Hey man, what's up?", "Yeah, yeah! Me too!", "Yeah.", "Well, I like danger.", "Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.", "It is starting to get dark out there.", "(laughing) Okay.

That sandwich really does smell good.", "I can't smell your sandwich?", "Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?", "Okay.", "Yeah.", "Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?", "How do you figure that?", "Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.", "Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.", "Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can", "!", "(deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.", "What's going on?", "Uh,", "!!", "(pouting) It was a car backfire!", "Who jumps at loud noises!", "Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you!

Ross!", "I do not hate Ross!", "What picture?", "Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!", "When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.", "From a bullet!", "", "sense?!", "So you risked your life, for a sandwich!", "So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.", "Really?!", "Thanks.

Because, it's so fast. It's fast!", "Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)", "So, what are you gonna do?", "Me?! Why me?", "I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.", "(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.

Happy?", "I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!", "Were you're parents happy, or something?", "Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.", "Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!", "(pause) Yeah, you're right about that.", "Hi!", "Yes I did, and I think you should do it.", "He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.", "I\u0092m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.", "Hey Gar!", "Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?", "All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)", "What?", "I'm not a dropper!", "It's throwing and catching!", "Oh! Oh! That's so hard.

Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!", "Oh that is over!", "You guys wanna eat here?", "Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm", "but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest.

(Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)", "What?", "Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?", "I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?", "So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?", "All right, bye-bye now!", "Okay!", "We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.", "Yeah.", "Isn't that Ross's money?", "I don't know.", "Okay!", "Too dry.", "No!", "No!", "Yes.", "I also said, \"Yes!\"", "No!

Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!", "You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.", "All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.", "(entering) Hey!", "Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!", "I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.", "Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.", "Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me.

I wanna talk to him!", "Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?", "That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn\u0085", "Really?", "(entering) Hey!", "(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!", "(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week!

You haven't been taking my calls in a week!", "Uh, what was that?", "(entering) Hey!", "I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.", "Huh.", "Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!", "Okay.", "Wow!", "Do we have to?", "Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.", "Yeah, I think we should see other people.", "Yes.", "It's a great idea.

Don\u0092t tell me I did this!", "How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?", "Ohh that's the", "thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!", "What-what Richard thing?", "What Richard thing?", "(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.", "Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)", "Oh my God.", "Love your condoms my man.", "Why?! What happened?!", "No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.", "No!

No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins!

I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.", "Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before?

Or\u0085", "(not quite sure) You did.", "Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one\u0092s free, right?

Y\u0092know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.", "Me too!", "No!", "Jeez, relax! It\u0092s not like we\u0092re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)", "(entering, slowly) Y\u0092know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?", "Well, what if all my stuff was here?", "Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I\u0092m saying?", "Me asking is kind of a sign.", "Okay!!!!!", "Okay.", "Oh thanks.", "The door hasn\u0092t been locked in five years, but okay!

How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?", "Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday\u0092s was just our thing man!", "Who was it?", "Sure!", "Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y\u0092know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like", "and", "for $200, the real ones!

(Hands it to him.)", "Uh, yeah.", "So, we\u0092ll do the rest of the bills later then?", "No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn\u0092t take it.", "I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y\u0092know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won\u0092t hurt his pride.", "Well that would help the pride thing.", "Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?", "Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?", "Hey!", "Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we\u0092d do nothing.", "Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.", "Yes, but for the last time.", "He\u0092s at a dinner party.", "Oh, I wish I\u0092d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.", "Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?", "Yes it would. What do you say to $50?", "Okay, let\u0092s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.", "Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.", "Oh yes!", "Okay.", "No! No! No!

Okay, let\u0092s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?", "You\u0092re kidding right?", "Well that\u0092s a full cup!

(He does.)", "Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.", "Hey, I didn\u0092t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don\u0092t get to excited because that\u0092s not gonna happen unless you get\u0097No way!

You love it!", "No, but wait\u0097what if I bought it from you, y\u0092know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?", "When did I try to give you money?", "I\u0092m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you\u0092re okay.", "(entering) Hey.", "I know. (He kisses her.)", "No problem roomie.

You can't come in here!

Thank God", "Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.", "That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)", "Uh-huh", "No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.

Why?", "What?!

You don\u0092t want to break her heart now do you?", "Yeah, she\u0092s dying\u0085 Of a cough apparently.", "(interrupting her) Okay, that\u0092s enough honey!", "Great! Okay, here.

I\u0092m marrying a dead woman!", "Guys? (They ignore him.) I\u0092ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I\u0092m gonna ask Monica to marry me.", "Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)", "Yep, pretty much.", "(goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy\u0097What?", "Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait \u0091til uh, it was official y\u0092know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you\u0092re my best friends.", "I\u0092m gonna ask Monica to marry me.", "I know.", "Check out the ring.", "Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)", "Okay, well tonight\u0092s the big night.", "It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I\u0092m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is.

I didn\u0092t agree to that!", "Will you marry me?", "you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) What\u0092s going on little elves?", "Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?", "Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she\u0092s gonna know.", "(To Monica) You are beautiful.", "(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It\u0092s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)", "Yes! Yes! I\u0092m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything\u0097are you\u0097are you perrr-perfect?!", "Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can\u0092t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should\u0092ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?", "Yes! I\u0092m fine. In fact I\u0092ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.", "Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn\u0092t imagine growing old with\u0085", "(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.", "What?! I\u0092m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, that\u0092s Richard!", "Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don\u0092t know why I did that!", "(to Richard\u0092s date) And uh, you don\u0092t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I\u0092m Chandler; I make jokes when I\u0092m uncomfortable.", "Hi.", "Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.", "Yeah, I\u0092ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)", "Yes. (Thinking he\u0092s gone.)", "I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.", "What?!", "(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!", "Richard!", "Oh you knew that. Good!", "For cam", "!", "Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you\u0092re not careful you may not get married at", "this year!", "(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!", "Richard was there so I couldn\u0092t do it!", "I\u0092m gonna do it tomorrow y\u0092know, and-and surprise her, but now you\u0092ve ruined it!", "Who walks into a room and asks to see a person\u0092s hands?!", "This is terrible. What am I going to do?", "That\u0092s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.", "I can do that, I\u0092ve had 30 years of practice.", "Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn\u0092t want to get married?", "Hey!", "Oh, just hanging out, talkin\u0092 about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.", "Yeah, well\u0085 Y\u0092know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?", "Eh\u0085", "Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let\u0092s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don\u0092t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that\u0092s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that\u0092s good at sports!", "If marriage worked, I\u0092d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.", "Well, never say never but y\u0092know probably uh yeah, never.", "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don\u0092t you put down your copy of \u0091The Rules\u0092 huh mantrap?!", "(to them) It\u0092s okay, I got a plan.", "I was making a coconut phone with the professor.", "What?!", "My\u0097Oh my God!", "He\u0092s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I\u0092m supposed to do that!", "Well what\u0085 Y\u0092know what I\u0092m gonna do? I\u0092m gonna go over there; I\u0092m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!", "You\u0092re right.", "Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I\u0092m gonna get the ring! I\u0092m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I\u0092m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I\u0092m just going to propose!", "Okay great.", "What?!", "Where is she? I\u0092m not scared of you!

Monica!", "Well where did she go?", "Oh my God, I can\u0092t believe this! Y\u0092know, I thought\u0085I thought you were a good guy.", "Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn\u0092t tell my girlfriend that you love her?", "Y\u0092know what? I can\u0092t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!", "And what does she have to think about? I love her!", "But I", "willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y\u0092know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she\u0092d be surprised!", "It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn\u0092t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because", "are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.", "Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?", "Y\u0092know Richard\u0085you are a good guy.", "I can\u0092t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!", "What?", "What are you talking about?", "Well why didn\u0092t you stop her?! Why didn\u0092t you just tell her it was a plan?!", "Well where\u0085 Where did she go?", "I can\u0092t believe I ruined this.", "Oh my God.", "Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought\u0085 (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you\u0092ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?", "Hey.", "Monica and I are engaged.", "Thanks.", "(To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I\u0092ll be in the closet.", "It\u0092s okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.", "To Monica!", "So when you said, \"Get up early,\" did you mean 1986?", "Okay.", "Know what I mean?", "There\u0092s gonna be a wedding. You\u0092re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.", "(motioning with his hands) I\u0092m not worried, I\u0092m uh, I\u0092m fascinated. Y\u0092know it\u0092s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.

(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!", "You look great!", "You okay over there?", "Oh, don\u0092t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.", "(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don\u0092t hurt me.", "Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.", "Young! You\u0092re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody\u0092s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!", "Joe?", "Uhh, you\u0092ve had a lot of sex right?", "Well, it\u0092s just the reason that I\u0092m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to\u0097I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn\u0092t\u0085. There huh\u0097hmm, there-there was an incident.", "It\u0092s happened to you?", "Well, what\u0092d you do?", "(angrily) I don\u0092t think that\u0092s what they were talking about Joe!!", "What?!", "Yes, you can pass for 19.", "Yes!", "Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!", "Now Monica, I know you\u0092re upset, but don\u0092t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and", "there\u0092s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.", "We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).", "Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love.

Give her the ring! I don\u0092t care!", "What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!", "(entering) Ahh, third base.", "(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.", "Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)", "How is that ever going to happen?!", "(To Ross) I don\u0092t care, she slept with me.", "Thanks.", "(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here\u0092s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.", "Okay.

Okay? The answer is no.", "Yes, I am!", "Hey.", "Ehh.", "Look, I thought about it too, and I\u0092m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.", "Yeah, I\u0092m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that\u0092s what we\u0092re gonna do.", "Eh, forget about the future and stuff!

Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y\u0092know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it\u0092s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.

No-no-no.", "No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.", "Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).", "Oh, okay, time's up!", "Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?", "Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in\u0085vegetables, Joey?", "Does South Oregon have a sports-team?

That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.", "Okay, but if you can't\u0085no dinner!", "Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.", "I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.", "Which smells delicious!", "What?", "Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!", "Huh! Where is the dog?!", "Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!", "What is it doing here?", "Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!", "(gasping) Really?", "Well, it still has to go, right?", "Okay, it's um\u0085", "(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time!

I'll slip him some money.", "Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)", "Okay.

(Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)", "Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.", "Hey Pheebs!", "If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?", "(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!", "Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)", "Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird\u0085turtle-man?", "What?", "You bet I did, Ben, put it there!

Really?", "Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?", "Then it's okay! (They kiss.)", "Because, if Santa and the Holiday\u0085Armadillo?

Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?", "My favorite part was when", "flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who\u0092s nodding.)", "Ohh. Mmm.", "Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.", "(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.", "I\u0097no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.", "Because it's too delicious.", "No-no-no!

Forget it!", "are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.", "Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?", "Well, thank you for lunch.", "So apparently we just don\u0092t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?", "Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)", "By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don\u0092t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.", "Well, we don\u0092t want that.", "But we should take it.", "Why?", "Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

(Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)", "Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.", "That\u0092s what Monica said.", "Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!", "I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.

Oh yes!", "Well that\u0092s not fair, you\u0092ve already had some!", "What do we", "to split it?", "(examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger.

Which one was", "and which one was", "?", "Sorry, I just\u0085can\u0092t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it?

You really do live in your own little world, don\u0092t ya?", "(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!", "Well, I got a job interview. It\u0092s kinda a big deal too.

I\u0092m crazy about us.", "Look, we\u0092ve always talked about having babies someday. I\u0092m not saying it has to be right now, but I\u0092m starting to think that we can handle it.

This is going to be fun.", "We\u0092re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Y\u0092know I\u0092m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?", "Period math?", "Yeah.", "Right here?", "Wait a minute, it\u0092s perfect.

Does the labor hurt?", "It\u0092s incredible, I mean one minute she\u0092s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.", "So, do you know what you\u0092re gonna call her yet?", "So then I guess Ferdinad is out.", "You do?", "Oh no, it\u0092s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn\u0092t it?", "That was amazing.", "And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.", "He pulled a quarter out of my ear!", "Okay. Wow.", "Sure.", "That was you?! I thought it was Jack!", "What?! Why does she think that?", "Again, what?!", "As we all are at some point during the day.", "Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?", "And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!", "Well, what did she say?", "Does Ross know?", "Well maybe you don\u0092t have to tell him anything.", "If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!", "Honey, we\u0092ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.", "I\u0092m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.", "Hello sir, you know Monica.", "Look, we can\u0092t stay in here forever.", "This is okay. We\u0092re all adults here; there\u0092s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let\u0092s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.

All over the wall.", "You still haven\u0092t told Rachel you weren\u0092t really proposing?", "Joey, you have to tell her what\u0092s going on! And what did it look like?!", "Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.", "Okay, look, just do it gently.", "Hey.", "Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)", "No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?", "Couldn\u0092t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn\u0092t sleep.\u00a0 Y\u0092know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I\u0092ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I\u0092ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn\u0092t fall asleep.", "Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.", "Walter (nods).", "Yep.", "(not knowing what he\u0092s saying yes to) Yes.", "(enters) Hey.", "Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?", "Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing", "Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?", "Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?", "People who\u0092ve never ever been to Paris.", "We\u0092re moving to Tulsa!

(She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don\u0092t think I can move to Tulsa.", "It\u0092s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I\u0092d move to Tulsa, I didn\u0092t really know what I was saying.", "But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain\u0092t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here\u0092s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won\u0092t go.

I like a girl with a strong jaw. I\u0092ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)", "(entering, loudly) Hey!", "Oh so there can\u0092t be any yelling.", "We\u0092re moving to Tulsa", "Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can\u0092t, I can\u0092t hear you.

If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.", "So, who does?", "I'm sorry, I won't be here.", "Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.", "Did I not mention that?", "(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)", "All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing \"Screw you, Mr. Bing!\" on the back of my chair!

You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.", "Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.", "Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!", "I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.", "Haha, no thanks!", "Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.", "Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...", "I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.", "What? That's terrible!", "Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.", "No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!", "No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.", "Why?", "No, I have a great idea for a present for her.", "If I help, we can find 'em faster!", "OK, Pheebs, your turn.", "And, a lemon lime.", "And last but not least.", "(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!", "Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)", "Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?", "What?", "You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!", "Why?", "But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.", "Fine, I'll give the suit back.", "Santa? Really?", "Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?", "Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)", "You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.", "Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.", "Good, God's speed, good people!

(The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.", "Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!", "Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.", "It is. Did I... not tell you about her?", "I sent them home.", "Uhh, uh...", "I don't know!", "I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.", "Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.", "BE-LOW me!", "Well, she... she didn't win...", "Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...", "Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.", "I'm serious!", "Merry Christmas.", "Merry Christmas, you guys!", "(hanging up the phone) The wife says \"Hi!\".", "Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.", "This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.", "Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)", "I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?", "(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!", "I'm *happily* married.", "Right. So, I'm sorry...", "Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.", "I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!", "You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?", "But we don't do that.", "How drunk are you?", "(thinks) That's the perfect amount!", "What?", "I know.", "Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?", "Okay!", "It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.", "Yep!", "Count of three?", "Two!", "Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.", "Eh! (They start making out again)", "So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?", "Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.", "Really? Okay, so...", "Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?", "Right!", "Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.", "Let's go! (Starts to leave.)", "Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.", "I don't think so.", "(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)", "No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.", "Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)", "Ehh.", "Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.", "Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.", "Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.", "Yeah.", "Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.", "Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.", "Sure you do.", "You sure?", "I love you so much.", "Hey!", "I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.", "Monica.", "I never want to leave you again!", "Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.", "Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?", "(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!", "I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.", "Thanks!", "(flattered) Ahh...", "(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)", "I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.", "I don't have a *job*!", "Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!", "Hey", "Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.", "I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice - not helping.", "Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.", "Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.", "Now that Rachel's gone?", "I wasn't staring. I was leering.", "Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.", "Seriously dude, 3 years ago.", "You don't trust him?", "Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.", "Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.", "Picturing that tree?", "Where you going, Joe?", "Oh. You mind if I join you?", "Your thoughts? Plural?", "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.", "Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.", "Great novels?", "(In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.", "(still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)", "(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)", "(normal voice) Hi", "Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?", "Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.", "See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.", "Wow.", "Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!", "Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.", "No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!", "I don't do that.", "I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?", "Today is the sixth.", "Yes, it's also 2003.", "It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.", "Tough crib.", "I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.", "I am not working. There's not much to do around here!", "Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.", "I - I don't think I can.", "Because of Emma.", "Sorry.", "Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.", "Well, I can't say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front of the B-A-B-Y.", "Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?", "You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.", "Emma was doing it!", "Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...", "I think we may have really done it this time.", "You may wanna get some more of those too.", "Where's Emma?", "Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!", "Okay. (Runs out.)", "All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.", "No, no, no.", "What? Why?", "Your family name is Tribbiani.", "Hey! Ready to go?", "What are you doin'?", "Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .", "The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?", "Bet she'd sleep with you now...", "Let me see what you wrote about yourself: \"Doctor Paleontology, two kids... \" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!", "Maybe we finish this for him!

It's the best sex I've ever had\"... aaand SEND!", "Oh, I'm so sorry!", "You're not gonna need my help?", "Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)", "I believe I read that somewhere!", "I respectfully disagree.", "Who cares? Nobody reads those things", "I don't have a page.", "Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.", "Would you get that please?

(\u00adlooks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?", "Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?", "No, come on, you know that's not true.", "Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.", "Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.", "Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.", "Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?", "Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !", "There you go! Someone came!", "(in a mournful voice) Please, come in.", "Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.", "At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)", "Some guy, Tom Gordon.", "(entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)", "Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)", "Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!", "You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!", "Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?", "I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.

Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)", "Or an uncle...", "Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.", "Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!", "Feminist issue. That's where I went!", "Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?

Come on, let's play!", "No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.", "Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!", "Wha-", "Hey!", "Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!", "Oh yeah!", "Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?", "Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)", "(Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?", "Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)", "Since then?!", "...I d'know.", "You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)", "Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.", "It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.

Can, uh, can we help you?", "I'm Joey Tribbiani.", "Dad, Ronni's here.", "Who-ah-ho.", "No you won't.", "If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.", "That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.", "Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.", "Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.", "Well, either you break it off with Ronni", "Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!", "I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!", "Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.", "I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...", "Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...", "No.", "You really think so?", "Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)", "(Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!", "Ma! What're you doing here?", "Oww! Big ring!", "Hold on, you-you knew?", "So then how could you I mean, how could you?!", "Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?", "I'm...happy...for you?", "Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.", "Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.", "With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.", "Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.", "Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.", "Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)", "Sorry. Wrong boobies.", "I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.", "You're in!", "Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.", "Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, \"Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.\"", "Think it'll work?", "Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.", "No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.", "Pathetic mess? I know, but\u0097come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.", "(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?", "No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.", "(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.", "Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?", "(to Lorraine) We can't do that.", "Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?", "Uh, we might be leaving now.", "She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.", "You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.", "I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.", "(in disbelief) Whoa.", "I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.", "(to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.", "So what're you going to do?", "How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.", "(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?", "I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.", "(tasting) Mmmm. Good.", "It's creamier.", "I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?", "Uh-oh.", "(in disbelief)", "?", "(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??", "What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.", "Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.", "....yeah... what else?", "(walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?", "Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me", ".", "Alright, now you say something.", "Come on! You like this woman, right?", "You want to see her again, right?", "Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!", "(turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.", "There you go! Keep going. Keep going!", "Say it... say it!", "Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.", "And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.", "What a tool!", "(to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?", "All right, Ross!", "Whoa! And the...

It looked like an eight, alright?", "Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)", "About what?", "Heh... I was", ".", "You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?", "(pause)...Yeah?", "No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.", "Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.", "But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.", "What?", "Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)", "That's fine. I'll just have a", "to hold me over.", "Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?", "Me too. Alright, whattaya got.", "Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.

Where do you go?", "Marcel?", "Marcel?", "A monkey.", "Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?", "Oh. Then, no.", "Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?", "We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.", "Marcel?", "I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.", "No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.", "Her answer machine?", "Duh, where've you been?", "Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!", "Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.", "Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.", "Maybe she never got your message.", "(entering) He's back! The peeper's back!", "(ducking) Get down!", "(intrigued) Yeah?", "..Naughty!", "Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...", "(watches them for a while) Oh my.", "(entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?", "I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.", "Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name!

I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...", "How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?", "No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.", "Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.

I think you'd remember that!", "Hey.", "Where've you been?", "(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.", "I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!", "Isn't there any way you can keep him?", "How do you get a monkey into a zoo?", "Did you call the cops?", "(entering) You know there already", "a Joseph Stalin?", "Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!", "Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?", "He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.", "We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...", "I dunno what to say, Ross.

They let the players run the team.", "Oh, it is.", "It is.", "Ew! What is that? Something exploded!", "(panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?", "Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!

I promise I'll pay you back.", "I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.", "Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.", "Oh, just, y'know.... science.", "(sigh)... It's a fertility study.", "Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really...

How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?", "He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.", "Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.", "We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)", "Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.", "Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...", "Then you do. Heh, heh.", "What do you mean?", "Not following you.", "(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.", "(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.", "Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.", "The country.", "He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.", "Heh, heh. It was nothin'.", "(panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.", "Sure! Why not?", "How do you mean?", "Shhhh!", "She's still asleep.", "Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?", "Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!", "It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.", "I know! Neither did I!", "Seven hundred bucks!", "Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.", "What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)", "Um, this?", "What up?!", "(answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)", "Needs some clothes altered?", "Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All right, when was 1990?", "(to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.", "No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.", "Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?", "Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.", "Can we see her?", "How're you doing?", "Ooh, that bad, huh?", "You gotta tell Ross how you feel.", "What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.", "Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.", "Frankie? What're you talking about?", "No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.", "That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?", "What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.", "Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...", "I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.", "(joins him) I gotta get one, too.", "Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.", "Uh, does it hurt?", "Chandler?", "Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?", "Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?", "(A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.)", "Who?", "What's he doin' in my section?", "Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok?

Bijan for men?", "(to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.", "(To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?!", "What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)", "Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...", "Exactly.", "(sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.", "Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.", "I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.", "Yeah I guess you're right.", "I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)", "Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.", "Yeah, I'm ready.", "These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?", "I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.", "Morning, hey, you made pancakes?", "(sarcastically) Good morning.", "(under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!", "B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.", "Come on, quite yankin' me.", "This is Janice.", "Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.", "(entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.", "Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?", "There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?", "Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?", "Wheel!", "Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!", "I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?", "Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.", "No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?", "Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.", "Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?", "Look, what do you want me to say?", "I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.", "Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')", "I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.", "And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...", "But what does that gonna do...", "Okay. I'm in.", "Does it have to be a whole day?", "Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.", "Hey!", "Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.", "I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.", "But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.", "No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.", "Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.", "Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.", "Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.", "(from bedroom) WHOAA!!", "Hey.", "No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)", "Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.", "What is this? Fruit?", "Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?", "This will just be my batch.", "Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?", "(with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?", "(with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)", "Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!", "Put your hands together.", "No more jam?!", "Check it out!! Jam crackers!", "Yeah, the Knicks rule!", "Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.", "Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?", "Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.", "Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.", "Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.", "Hey.", "Where you going?", "Sperm or regular?", "So you're really doing this, huh?", "Sounds nice.", "No kiddin', hmm.", "No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.", "I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.", "It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.", "He's got the body for it.", "You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.", "Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.", "Yeah!", "Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.", "Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day.

Now, I\u0092ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I\u0092m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let\u0092s say I wanna convey that I\u0092ve just done something evil.

Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad\u0092s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....", "I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.", "I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should\u0092ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.", "I ran!!", "(entering from his bedroom) Morning.", "(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin\u0092 huh?", "Listen, I ah, I know it\u0092s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?", "Yeah. You okay?", "Yeah.", "Where have you been?", "(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?", "Done.", "So Pheebs what\u0092s this guy like?", "Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?", "Yeah!", "Uh, y'know what, we\u0092re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we\u0092ll need a little more time to think about it.", "Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)", "We\u0092ll be there.", "Uh, 10:30.", "4:30.", "Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?", "She was kidding about that right?", "God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?", "Dude, I don\u0092t know.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don\u0092t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don\u0092t want to be seeing.", "Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?", "Yeah, I guess, but what\u0092s like heads and what\u0092s tails?", "So what are you gonna do?", "Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.", "Nothing, he\u0092s just really believes in that.", "(Voice Over) Previously on Friends.", "Yeah. We figured when we couldn\u0092t find you, you\u0092d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?", "Look, Ross look, I\u0092m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that\u0092s gonna get you in trouble.", "Yeah, and there won\u0092t be a relationship left to rebuild.", "All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn\u0092t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?", "(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!", "Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that\u0092s all. I mean, come on, it\u0092s just a little wax.", "Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?", "Don\u0092t answer that.", "Awful! Horrible!", "She was nothing compared to you.", "Ewwwww!", "Y'know what, I don\u0092t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)", "Why not?! (to Chandler) I\u0092m hungry.", "Yeah, we\u0092ll be fine.", "Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.", "You think I need a new walk?", "Well y'know, I\u0092ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a \u0091take notice\u0092 walk.", "Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a \u0091come on\u0092 look.) Yeah, okay.", "Maybe she killed him?", "(whispering) No, I really have to pee.", "Can I see the comics?", "Okay,", "I see the comics?", "Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.", "Well Ross was hangin\u0092 out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....", "Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.", "Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.", "I had the same dream!", "Oh, I had the opposite dream.", "Yeah, I mean it\u0092s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.", "Rach, it\u0092s, it\u0092s ah, it\u0092s not that we don\u0092t want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?", "(He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths \u0091Come on!\u0092) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.", "Oh yeah.", "You\u0092re smoking again?!", "(obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!", "It\u0092ll be great for next weekend.", "It\u0092ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it\u0092ll be grrreat.", "Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother\u0092s cab, but y'know what, I\u0092ll stay.", "(to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?", "What? Mine aren\u0092t tinted.", "Oh, now I have to go!!", "What\u0092s going on?", "Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?", "Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!", "Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?", "Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.", "If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.", "Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.", "(opening the door) And there you go!", "Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.", "Okay, done.", "That\u0092s \u0091help\u0092 spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!", "Arrrghh!!", "Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?", "I-I can\u0092t handle this, you guys.", "(pause) What?", "(pause) What?", "Yeah, and not put us in the middle.", "Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who\u0092s going with who?", "Come on man, you drove all the way up here.", "Oh, nothing, no. It\u0092s an acting exercise, I\u0092m practising my fake laugh.", "What-what\u0092s so funny?", "Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.", "Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.", "Well, have-have you told him how you feel?", "So, we\u0092re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, \u0093Hey, let\u0092s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,\u0094 remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, \u0093Nah, let\u0092s just hang out at your place.\u0094 Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.", "Yeah, come on, think about it. You\u0092re 18, okay, she\u0092s 44, when you\u0092re 36, she\u0092s gonna be 88.", "Look, the point is, there\u0092s a lot of women out there you haven\u0092t even had sex with yet!", "Yeah, in a poem maybe.", "Now, wh-what, what is that like?", "(to Ross) Why can\u0092t I find that?", "Well, I want it!", "I don\u0092t know, maybe I can\u0092t. I mean, maybe there\u0092s something wrong with me.", "Then you hold on to it!!", "All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)", "I couldn\u0092t help it, there love is so pure.", "Hey!", "Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?", "Every night!!", "(He\u0092s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey\u0092s your best friEnd.

She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can\u0092t do it, they\u0092re all like-like laughing at me.", "Wow, what-what do you think she wants?", "Oh, oh, I got it!

One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you\u0092ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so\u0085 I\u0092m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I\u0092m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you\u0092ll be long gone. But I won\u0092t have aged at all.

My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.", "Yeah, maybe it\u0092s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)", "Yeah. What are we getting?", "Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.

And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?", "Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)", "(sitting back down) Was the chord at least right\u0085", "Howdy partner!", "Umm?", "Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)", "Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!", "Now? You want me to go over there now?", "Do you know something?", "I might know something.", "What's the thing you know?", "I can't tell you what I know.", "Okay, fine.", "You don't know!", "(gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!", "Yeah, I know!!!!", "Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen\u0085 (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)", "Oh,", "am going to go for a walk in the rain.", "Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.", "Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.", "(thinks) I don't know.", "I don't know.", "(thinks) I don't know.", "Ohh, I know one thing!", "They did it right there on the couch.", "Hey Ross!", "(eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?", "(entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?", "Really?", "Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.", "All right, let's go Pheebs.", "Maybe we should check the trash chute.", "That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.", "(snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.", "He hooked up!! Tell us about her!", "All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.", "Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!", "Damnit Phoebe!!", "All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?", "All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)", "Judge rules, no violation.", "Yeah!", "What?!", "And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!", "Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.", "Yeah.", "(entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?", "Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.", "Umm, hi.", "Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.", "Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)", "Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.", "Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.", "Great! Thanks, Rach!", "All right.", "Are you all right?", "Pheebs! Sorry!", "Pheebs, I'm so sorry.", "All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.", "Really? A purse?", "It looks like a women's purse.", "See look,", ", carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.", "Maybe you need sex.", "had sex a couple days ago.", "Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.", "Hey!", "What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!", "Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)", "Why would I return it? I love this bag!", "Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)", "All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.", "U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.)", "Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.", "Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)", "(approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)", "What did you say to him?", "(entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?", "Y'know what? Make fun all you want.", "is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)", "(reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.", "Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should\u0097I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)", "Well, first it's not a purse.", "I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!", "All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!", "Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.", "Yeah but I didn\u0092t read anything.", "Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!", "(dejected) Hi.", "Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)", "Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.", "Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!", "Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!", "I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!", "I can't believe I'm hearing this!", "Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!", "(entering) Hey guys!", "What? What?", "You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)", "Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!", "No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.", "I can't take any\u0085", "Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!", "Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)", "Ugh.", "Yeah?", "Well", "didn't tell them!", "Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.", "And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!", "I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and", "can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!", "No! Not unless! Look this must end now!", "I'm listening.", "So he likes to break stuff.", "Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.", "No.", "They know you know.", "I couldn't even if I wanted too.", "(looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!", "(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!", "Ooh!", "I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)", "It's not my first time.", "Dude!", "All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!", "(panicking) Dude! He's right there!", "Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?

Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.", "(quickly) I call Godfather!", "Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.", "(to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.", "So, are you ready to go?", "Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)", "I was thinking Chinese food.", "I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but\u0085", "(shyly) She keeps punching me.", "Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.", "(sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.", "Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you.

Absolutely.", "No-no.", "Yeah, big!", "Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.", "Hey!", "Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?", "Well look, I\u0092m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?", "Hey! Hiya!", "Huh.", "Uhh\u0085.", "Nah.", "What a bad idea!", "She's right y'know.", "Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?", "Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.", "That's not funny at all!", "Hey!", "What are you guys doing up?", "(thinks) Dark red.", "Aww, you guys are so cute!", "All right, I'll see you in the morning.", "Dream", "Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.", "Dream", "Cat.", "Dream", "I love you too.", "(entering) Hey, you guys!", "(To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?", "Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I\u0092m not him.", "No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!", "No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the bathroom.)", "(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.", "Yeah, I didn\u0092t know you guys were going to be here.", "(backing away) What?! Why?!", "Nothing!", "All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)", "Well, it involved Monica.", "Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.", "Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and", "were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.", "It-it doesn\u0092t?", "That kinda sounds like your dream dude.", "In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.", "(looks at her) Not really.", "No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?", "Friends first? That's interesting.", "No, never done that either.", "(in a sexy voice) How you doin'?", "Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.", "Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.", "Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.", "Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great\u0085", "\u0085is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, \"Who are my friends?\" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So\u0085", "I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.", "I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)", "Won't-won't that take longer?", "Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause)", ", I wish I saw Phoebe first!", "(entering) Hey!", "Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)", "Uhh, well, she's\u0085really good in bed.", "(To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!", "Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her roommate!", "Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!", "(entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!", "(taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?", "Phoebe and", "Oh my God!", "Uhh, just a minute officer!!", "Chandler and", "Nice!", "Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!", "I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.", "That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.", "Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.", "(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.", "Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor\u0085", "Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)", "This is your place?", "But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)", "Ugh!!", "I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. (Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)", "Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?", "What happened?", "You kissed him?!", "I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?", "Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?", "Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's back!", "No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)", "Damnit!! Did you move?!", "(Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?", "Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?", "Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!", "(entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.)", "I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.) Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.", "Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.", "No. No. No. She lives on the", "floor,", "apartment from the left.", "I did", "know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.", "Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)", "Okay, pick a card.", "All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?", "(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)", "(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.", "I'm", "on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!", "Luck!", "Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.", "Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!", "Done.", "They're gonna do it together.", "What, so I gotta shut it down now?", "Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?", "Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.", "What?! Are you kidding?!", "All right!", "Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!", "I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her\u0085", "Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,", ", and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad\u0085.", "That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?", "I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)", "(also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.", "(Happily) Yeah I did!", "Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so\u0085", "Who knows?", "Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!", "Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.", "Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!", "Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.", "Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.", "That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!", "I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!", "What? Chandler! Tell 'em!", "At least I care about his feelings!", "Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn\u0092t get it?", "Oh, come on! Have you", "what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!", "You just give him a spoon baby!", "Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!", "Yeah?! So's yours!", "Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.)", "soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!", "Oh yeah, no problem.", "(goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.", "stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.", "(angrily) Ross!", "Hi!", "Uh-oh.", "Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.", "Oh, what did I say?", "How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!", "Hmm, noodle soup.", "Okay.", "Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!", "No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)", "Hey.", "Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)", "Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, \"Hmm, noodle soup.\" (Nods his head in disgust.)", "What you do mean?", "Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.", "Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor\u0085", "No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.", "Thank you! So, did-did he get it?", "Eh, what are you gonna do?", "(entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!", "Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.", "She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.", "Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so\u0085", "Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?", "Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.", "Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.", "(walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)", "Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.", "(smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.", "(smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.", "(smiling) Not likely.\u00a0 'Cause you see that body bag right there", "(smiling) I'm in it.", "(smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of", "she almost died.", "(smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)", "Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)", "No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.", "(To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!", "I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!", "(dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)", "(entering) Hey! Is the show still on?", "(says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)", "Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!", "(on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!", "That's right!", "(on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it\u0085(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!", "(on the tape) I'm comin' out!

Next week's!", "Oh, yeah, good idea.", "Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)", "Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!", "(to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!", "You got to go on a ride along?!", "I want to go on a ride along!", "(returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!", "Oh-ho, yeah!", "Yep!", "(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.", "Yeah, okay.", "Did I say you could smell it?!", "Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!", "Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.", "Are you thinking about Monica?", "Yeah, what's that like?", "Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?", "Oh what?

I\u0085knew\u0085you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!", "Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.", "I know it doesn't make much sense\u0085", "Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!", "I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!", "No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!", "Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.", "No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!", "How good is that?", "See?", "Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!", "Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!", "Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)", "Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?", "Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.", "Hey, what time is it?", "Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?", "Yeah.

Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.", "Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y\u0092know? The only problem is, Carl\u0092s acting is\u0085 (Does the international hand symbol for so-so.)", "Yeah, he\u0092s the reason I didn\u0092t get that big", "commercial a couple of years ago remember?

The candy.", "Hey!", "Erin.", "(skeptical) What party?", "Who\u0092s birthday party?", "(still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?", "(still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.", "Hey.", "Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!", "No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y\u0092know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.", "Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that\u0092s a\u0085", "Okay.", "How can you say that?! The", "have no closer!", "What about Game 1 of the Series?", "You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) I\u0092ll be right back.", "(returning) Hey! You wanna go?", "Okay. See you guys later.", "(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)", "Hey!", "Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still\u0085 And guess what, I\u0092m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.", "No-no-no-no-no! It\u0092s a surprise, but it\u0092s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.", "Where are you gettin\u0092 this?", "Oh. Oh.", "No hey Rach, it\u0092s cool okay? Y\u0092know I\u0092m a loner too! (Heads for his room.) Right?", "No!

How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!", "46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?", "(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.", "But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?", "Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.", "What the hell is in there?", "Yeah that dog left!", "(interrupting him) Don't do it!", "Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)", "Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin\u0092 ice cream.", "Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)", "All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.", "Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.", "Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.", "(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!", "(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)", "(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?", "So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.", "Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.", "Ross, you need some help?", "(sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!", "Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.", "If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.", "Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!", "You think?", "Hey.", "I do.

Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!", "(about to cry) Those two only had each other!", "Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin\u0092 it by the park.", "Hey Pheebs?", "Hey Rach?", "That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? (He shows her what he\u0092s been drawing.)", "Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.", "(watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?", "Yeah lady! Give us candy!!", "What\u0092s up buddy?", "Waiting for candy.", "(stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!", "That\u0092s right, it\u0092s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.)

(To Rachel) Ready? One, two, three, four...", "Rachel and", "Tequila!!", "Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey Pheebs!", "Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.", "What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?", "Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what is it?", "Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into his room)", "(entering wearing a", "costume) Merry Christmas!", "(yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?", "Cage closed?", "All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y\u0092know I\u0092m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I\u0092m not brain dead.", "Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it\u0092s just not my character that\u0092s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?", "I\u0092ll see you at 8:00.", "(entering) Hey!", "Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!", "Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!", "Wow! I\u0092m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.", "Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I\u0092m sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I\u0092ll pay for myself!", "The Ross\u0097Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)", "Awww! Mel Torme died.", "Aw! Does that mean the", "sale is over?!", "Hey.", "Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross\u0092s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y\u0092know, since she has a chance to get on broad back\u0085", "Aww that\u0092s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.", "(entering) Hey!", "(seeing what they\u0092re doing) What do you got there?", "Huh? Uh\u0085 (He starts taking off his pants.)", "Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I\u0092ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?", "What?! Tonight?!", "After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she\u0092s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!", "Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin\u0092 here?", "Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.", "Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) Y\u0092know what Pheebs?", "You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.", "Y\u0092know-y\u0092know what I really want?", "Is to have a long, long talk. Y\u0092know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.", "Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.", "What\u0092s the rush? What?", "Whoa-whoa, what is it?", "A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn\u0092t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!", "No, I\u0092m gonna!! That\u0092s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin\u0092 out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you\u0092re doing the same thing!", "Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!", "Well, she graduated from high school!", "Fine!", "Fine!", "(to the waiter) What are you still doin\u0092 here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!", "No! No! No Pheebs, I\u0092m not gonna yell at you. I just y\u0092know, started thinking about you and David and I\u0085remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just\u0085 Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?", "Hey, y\u0092know you could always visit him.", "Anything I can do? Whatever you need.", "I can give it a shot.", "(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin\u0092? (Starts digging in.)", "(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y\u0092know what else makes you wonder?", "Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)", "Then why are you wearing Monica\u0092s jacket?", "(whispering) Ross!", "Come here, check this out!", "No! No-no. Look, there\u0092s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down to get a closer look.)", "(standing up) Y\u0092know, there\u0092s", "women dude.", "Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)", "(annoyed) I don\u0092t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause) Yeah, I do.", "What?! All right\u0097Hey! Don\u0092t look at me! You\u0092re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid", "comet!", "(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)", "Come on!", "All right well, y\u0092know\u0085I guess we know what we have to do to get down.", "Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it out.)", "All right, it won\u0092t go down any further. It\u0092s stuck.", "Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!", "What if I smack my head on the concrete?", "(looks at the ground and at Ross) I don\u0092t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let\u0092s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?", "No.", "What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I\u0092m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can\u0092t go if I break my leg.", "Well all right so, it looks like we\u0092re even!", "Man, I\u0092m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! \"Do you want soup or salad?\" Both! Always order both!", "Yeah? Really? No one\u0092s home?", "Yeah!", "All right! Just hurry up!", "I think face to face.", "Face to face, yeah!", "All right.", "(grunting) Oh my\u0085 How much do you weigh Ross?!", "Y\u0092know, when we talked about face to face, I don\u0092t think we thought it all the way through.", "Well, just shimmy down me and drop!", "Hi.", "(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!", "It\u0092s not that far! Just drop!", "Ross, you should know that my pants are startin\u0092 to come down and I\u0092m not wearing any underwear!", "Hey.", "What are you doing?", "(laughs) Why would you want to do that?", "Rach, there", "a decent place to\u0085", "No. No. No.", "No. Rosita does not move.", "As in Rosita does not move.", "The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it\u0092s at the perfect angle so you don\u0092t get any glare coming of off Stevie.", "(glaring at her) Is there a problem?", "I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don\u0092t, and I did it anyway and her", "fell off?", "(slowly turning and glaring at her) She\u0092s not even cold yet!", "That\u0092s true.", "Yeah, I\u0085 (Shuts off the TV.) I don\u0092t want Stevie to see her like this.", "No I won\u0092t.", "Because, I know what I like and what I don\u0092t like! It\u0092s not the same thing!", "I don\u0092t know why you say that so soon.", "Francette? What is she? A couch?", "Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.", "Well, I guess you\u0092re right. Maybe, maybe I\u0092ll take her down to the incinerator. It\u0092s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back, but it doesn\u0092t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) She\u0092s heeled!", "No it\u0092s not weird, it\u0092s a miracle!", "Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!", "(interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?", "Miracle!", "Someone like an\u0085angel?", "(angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.)", "Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)", "Fine.", "No. Really?", "(quietly) My chair heels itself.", "Well, it looks like it wasn\u0092t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)", "", "chair?!", "So, there was no miracle?!", "(sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken.

We are!", "Oh yeah.", "Ahhh\u0085\u0085 (To Rachel) Eh?", "Hey!", "They do!", "Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.", "(screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in Phoebe\u0092s lap for comfort.)", "(screaming) And now Chandler! We\u0092re all gettin\u0092 so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)", "Yeah, you\u0092re roommate is a soap opera star.", "Hey, what\u0092s the horsepower on this thing?", "But it hurt\u0092s my Joey\u0092s Apple.", "Well actually\u0085", "Dude, you soooo need this car.", "Yep. (Starts for Monica\u0092s room, but Chandler stops him.)", "Now that you\u0092re a couple, we don\u0092t get two presents from you guys?", "Will you quit hoggin\u0092 it!", "(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?", "Yeah!!", "Oh, I don\u0092t know Pheebs. It\u0092ll be okay.", "That\u0092s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!", "Like what?", "Hey, y\u0092know what you guys? I think I\u0092m gonna go walk her home. (Gets up and runs out.)", "Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that\u0092s one thing you can cross off your list.", "Oh, and plus I\u0092m 1/16", "Portuguese.", "Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!", "Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?", "Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)", "Yes!", "(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don\u0092t like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)", "(crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Ross\u0092s shoulder.)", "All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let\u0092s go!", "No.", "(entering, excited) Hey!", "So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and\u0085", "", ". Anyway, you\u0092re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!", "And-and-and not only that, I\u0092m gettin\u0092 a new brain!!", "Oh well, they\u0092re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.", "(seriously) Yes, it\u0092s a highly controversial procedure.", "Well, I think it\u0092s ridiculous that you haven\u0092t had sex in three and a half months.", "Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.", "Nice.", "Oh, tell me about it. And she\u0092s been on the show forever, it\u0092s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.", "Yes, but in Drake Remoray\u0092s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!", "That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?", "Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.", "Say what?", "No. No, I\u0092m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I\u0092m the guy in the coma!", "An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I\u0092m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me\u0085", "(quickly) I don\u0092t know. Why? Did you hear something?", "Oh uh, one of the writers.", "Umm\u0085", "Okay.", "Ms. Monroe\u0085 (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)", "So you like the nachos uh? Myself I\u0092m partial to\u0085", "See you in 2003. (She walks away.)", "I\u0092m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.", "No I mean it! I can\u0092t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!", "Joey.", "Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye\u0097l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I\u0092m really nervous about-about being you. Y\u0092know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y\u0092know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?", "Oh that\u0092s great! Oh thank you so much!", "Hey! Now, I\u0092ve been watching some tapes, how\u0092s this? (In a British accent.) \"Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!

(He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)", "Oh well\u0097Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y\u0092know? It\u0092ll-it\u0092ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You\u0092re so talented.", "Hey that\u0092s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb\u0097Angelina Jolie!", "Like-like what?", "(impressed) Wow!", "Oh hey come on, don\u0092t-don\u0092t-don\u0092t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I\u0092m thinking, \"Boy, she-she is a great actress!\" (She\u0092s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, \"She is hot!\"", "You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh\u0085", "Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that \u0091cause she\u0092s so passionate?", "Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)", "Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.", "Hey!", "That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.", "(shrugs) Sure. Yep.", "Okay, bye-bye.", "All right, here we go.

I\u0085", "(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!", "They sent me today\u0092s script! They never send the script!", "Well no, I\u0092m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh\u0085", "(flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.", "Yeah well, I\u0092m guessing after this she\u0092s not going to be crazy about electricity either.", "(as Jessica) I don\u0092t think so.", "Oh noo\u0085", "Thanks!", "Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!", "The airport?", "Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?", "That\u0092s a really long time.", "Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again\u0097That is\u0097I tell ya, that is a tricky one!", "Good luck.", "I call it!!", "Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!", "So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?", "Well then let me do it!", "No-no-no! Look, I\u0092ve been thinking about it. I\u0092m an actor right? So I won\u0092t get nervous talking in front of people.", "No-no-no-no look no! I won\u0092t spit, and I won\u0092t stare at Monica\u0092s breasts! Y\u0092know? Everyone knows I\u0092m an ass man!", "Yeah and the most important thing is that it won\u0092t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It\u0092ll be me! And I swear I\u0092ll do a really good job. Plus, y\u0092know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.", "So I can do it?", "All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?", "Okay.", "Oh! My head! Oh!

(Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)", "Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!", "Anyway, I started working on what I\u0092m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?", "Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so\u0085 (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) \"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.\" (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) \"It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving.\" (Phoebe nods her approval.) \"We too can share and love and have and receive.\"", "Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?", "(reading) \"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and\u0085\" And then I can\u0092t think of a good word for right here.

There\u0092s some really nice girls down there.", "All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)", "That\u0092s what that was?! \u0091Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.", "Oh\u0085 (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn\u0092t left you that last one? You two might\u0092ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It\u0092s like it was in the stars!", "Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.)

Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?", "No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.", "Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!", "Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!", "Monkey lover!", "When do you think we lost her?", "Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.)

I uh, I didn\u0092t prepare a speech. But umm, I\u0092d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my parents, who\u0092ve always been there for me. I\u0092d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel\u0085", "Yeah may-maybe you don\u0092t tell anyone about this.", "Really?", "What award are you practicing for?", "Oh, hey listen! The Soapie\u0092s called today and I also get to present an award.", "Yeah!", "(confused) What you-you don\u0092t think I\u0092m gonna win?", "Yeah.

(Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he\u0092s on TV right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)", "(angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from", "Erin Goff. (There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From", "Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from", "Sarah Mchann, and from", "Jessica Ashley.

She\u0092d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who\u0092s sittin\u0092 right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)", "Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!

But the audition went really good.", "Oh, it\u0092s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It\u0092s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.", "Yeah, there\u0092s this guy from Chicago who\u0092s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy\u0092s right after him. (Joey\u0092s cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!", "(to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!", "(on phone) Oh my God!", "Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)", "They want me to be totally naked in the movie!", "I know! My grandmother\u0092s gonna see this!", "I don\u0092t know! It\u0092s not like it\u0092s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y\u0092know? And the nudity is really important to the story.", "You\u0092re right. Maybe I shouldn\u0092t even go on the call back.", "Well that\u0092s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character\u0092s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It\u0092s really sweet and-and tender.", "Hey, I\u0092m back!", "Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?", "Oh great! Y\u0092know I would\u0092ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y\u0092know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)", "And scene! Huh? Wasn\u0092t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?", "Wow! Sure! That\u0092s great!", "Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it\u0092s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.", "So\u0085What?", "Yes!", "No. What?", "Barmifsaed?", "Nope.", "Yep.", "That\u0092s right.", "I don\u0092t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell \u0091em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.", "I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.", "I just have to call my agent and tell her I can\u0092t do the part. (Gets up for the phone.)", "Unless what?", "Like what?", "Wow! This looks great!", "And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?", "Thank God!", "Ah.", "Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)", "Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.", "Ow!", "Yeah.", "The fruit roll up.", "Delicious.", "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!", "The", "! It\u0092s not so silly anymore!", "And what\u0092s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?", "My whole family\u0092s from Naples!", "Oh! Hey right! Not a problem.

One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, there\u0092s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.", "Probably Monica and Chandler.", "Hey guys!

(Stares at her.)", "Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?", "What they\u0092re not invited?! Oh no, that\u0092s terrible! They\u0092re gonna be crushed!", "(looking around) You got me. I don\u0092t\u0085", "Well, I\u0092m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y\u0092know? Your parents are comin\u0092! Chandler\u0092s parents are comin\u0092!

Parents are comin\u0092!", "(leaning down to her) Maybe you\u0092ll order a little sangria?", "We should really learn how to play the real way.

Ooh, and maybe a hat.", "I don\u0092t think so.", "(excitedly) Can I come?! I won\u0092t even talk! You\u0092ll just hear the noise from my video camera.", "Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!", "Okay\u0085", "Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!", "Why are you taking this away from me?", "Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.", "Hey.", "Yeah, they\u0092re not coming.", "Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They\u0085feel a little unwanted.", "Look Mon, if you could just call my mom\u0085", "Come on! Look just-just tell\u0097let her know that you really want them to be there. Let\u0092s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.", "Is it her fault that some of them didn\u0092t make it to you?", "I don\u0092t know. Just uh, just tell \u0091em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or\u0097No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They", "the post office. And the Irish! But I don\u0092t think you can blame it on them so\u0085 (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)", "(entering) Hey.", "Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?", "Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it\u0092s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?", "Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it\u0092s the same day as my niece\u0092s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. \u0091Cause my part\u0092s just in the beginning I\u0092m not even in the rest of the show\u0097Wedding!", "Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little \u0091til they get there?", "Yeah! Yeah y\u0092know, like warm up the crowd.

They\u0092re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.", "Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.", "All right, uh\u0085 (To Ross) Oh hey, you\u0092ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?", "Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, \"Monica\u0085", "\"\u0085when I look back over our time together\u0085\"", "Well, I can\u0092t do everything! Look back over your time together.", "(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We\u0092re dying out here!", "Hey!", "How is \"Monica, I love your sweet ass,\" inappropriate?", "(shocked) Has it been that long?!", "Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!", "Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?", "Okay.", "I know! I mean it\u0092s not like we weren\u0092t cool about it.", "(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!", "How?! When?!", "", "But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!", "All right! Man, this is unbelievable!", "Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what.

(To all) Dearly beloved, I\u0092m sorry I\u0092m a little late. You may be confused by this now, (He\u0092s still in costume) but you won\u0092t be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let\u0092s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I\u0092ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can", "imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I\u0092ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?", "Chandler?", "You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?", "Yeah you do!", "Aw crap! Okay\u0097uh\u0085uh let\u0092s-let\u0092s do the rings.", "We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.", "Ha-ha.

Check it out! (Hands her one.)", "Oh! Ooh-ooh!", "You\u0092re still a tiny bit on fire there.", "Mornin\u0092", "I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can\u0092t even say, \"Hmm, noodle soup?\"", "(cracking up) Nope, you lost me.", "Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on the floor.) I\u0092ll be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)", "(Pause) Sorry. (Raises his hand in shame.)", "I don\u0092t know, but it smells good. (He gets up and heads for the door only to stop short and start laughing.)", "Nothin\u0092.", "Oh yeah, and she\u0092s really nice too! She taught me about y\u0092know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.", "You\u0092re still a tiny bit on fire there!", "What? What\u0092s going on?", "Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!", "Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)", "I can\u0092t! I-I don\u0092t have any other clothes here.", "I\u0092m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it\u0092s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what\u0092s more important, the way I\u0092m dressed or me being with you on your special day?", "That\u0092s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)", "I don\u0092t believe we\u0092ve met, Joey Tribbiani.", "Wow, I\u0092ve admired your work for years. You-you\u0092ve done some really amazing stuff.", "Wow Dennis Phillips! That\u0092s great! How did you guys meet?", "Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? \u0091Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would\u0092ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that\u0092s just for ugly people.", "Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.", "Uh, I don\u0092t even really know where I left those. Sorry.", "Okay fine! I\u0092m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I\u0092ll show ya!", "Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?", "No-no! No! No! You don\u0092t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I\u0092m a soap actor.", "Hey!", "(clinks his glass) I\u0092d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) \"Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!\" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I\u0092m sorry. And-and some scared memories\u0097Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I\u0092ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!", "So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?", "Well, I\u0092d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you\u0092re casting for this new show\u0085", "Oh, see that\u0092s where you\u0092re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn\u0092t see it up there, just-just try me.", "Well I\u0092m not proud of this, but\u0085 (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)", "Shh. Shh. Don\u0092t try to talk, we\u0092ll get you up to your room, we\u0092ll soak your feet, you\u0092ll be okay.", "Yeah.", "Tell me about it, I feel like I\u0092m holding down the fort all by myself.", "Yeah.", "(entering) Hey!", "No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!", "Nothing! It was something.", "Yeah, that\u0092s sad. Mashuga nut?", "(entering) Hey!", "(warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!", "Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?", "Oh my God Pheebs! You\u0092re gonna have a baby?", "Whoa, wait a minute. Who\u0092s the father?", "Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? \u0091Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!", "David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)", "(entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?", "Okay.", "Okay. (Hands her one.)", "Oh good, uh you\u0092re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.", "Umm, now uh\u0085 It\u0092s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y\u0092know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so\u0085 (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?", "Why?! Why can\u0092t she marry me?!", "Oh my God.", "(smiles then stops) Now I can\u0092t believe it! What? Rachel\u0092s pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who\u0092s the father?", "Ohh\u0085 I wonder if that dude.", "Yeah.", "About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn\u0092t see who it was but\u0085 (He walks out and closes the door.)", "The guy left this.", "(entering) You opened them all?", "Oh hey! You got my parent\u0092s gift! (Holds it up.)", "Well, I don\u0092t know. I think it does something to salami.", "Yeah. What-what did Tag say?", "I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)", "Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you\u0092re not gonna be alone in this.", "Listen I uh\u0085 (He takes her hand.) It\u0092s a scary world out there especially if you\u0092re a single mom. Y\u0092know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y\u0092know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?", "Pheebs, give me the ring back!", "(heartbroken) I understand.", "Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered\u0085", "There you go!", "(slow on the uptake) Oh my God!", "(entering with Phoebe) Hey!", "We know its Ross!", "I\u0092m gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)", "Well that, that sounds good.", "Bye.", "What secrets?", "(whispering to Chandler) You\u0092ll tell me later?", "Y\u0092know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.", "I don\u0092t have a key, they took mine to give to you.", "Why would they take away our keys?", "No that\u0092s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.", "Hey, I washed those!", "Yeah that didn\u0092t sound like me.", "Yeah, I have stuff in there too.", "Monica\u0092s chicken parm! I\u0092ll take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it\u0092s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler\u0092s apartment. It\u0092s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.

You trust me with yours.", "What the hell is that?", "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?", "(eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)", "So it\u0092s noticeable huh?", "(simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can\u0092t believe that!!", "How are you doing?", "Well, what did you say to her?", "(shocked) What?", "Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don\u0092t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!", "What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)", "Hey Monica it\u0092s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin\u0092 from your apartment.", "Yeah and we\u0092d go check it out, but you took away our keys.", "How? I guess I could break down your door.", "And-and you won\u0092t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs up.)", "Uh, okay I\u0092ll-I\u0092ll-I\u0092ll break it down.

Oh-oh, I got something. It\u0092s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they\u0092re like putty.", "Okay. Now you\u0092re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is", "the story.", "Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe\u0085", "Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)", "I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I saw\u0085a beautiful woman\u0085bathing herself\u0085but she was crying\u0085", "Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?", "Hey! Look, if it didn\u0092t work it\u0092s because you didn\u0092t tell it right!

I\u0092ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you\u0092re doing wrong.", "All right now\u0085 All right, you\u0092re all set up. You\u0092re good to go. Just hit record. All right?", "Good luck.", "Yeah?", "(trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)", "Y\u0092know what? This is not fair to her. Let\u0092s just forget the tape!", "You\u0092re right. (Mouths, \"I know you\u0092ll show me, right?)", "Loud and clear! (Mouths, \"You\u0092ll show me,\" and nods.)", "Y\u0092know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn\u0092t give you real names either.", "Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.", "Uh no Rach, he\u0092s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.", "(confused) Are we watchin\u0092 the tape or not?!", "(To Phoebe) I\u0092m so happy!", "How do", "know about that story?!", "(raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)", "(raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!", "(To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.", "I\u0092m not telling, you\u0092ll have to see it on TV!", "No, couldn\u0092t care less.", "Hey you too!", "What?

He even asked me if I thought you\u0092d go out with him.", "I said no.", "What? I\u0085I just figured since you\u0092re pregnant you\u0092re not gonna be seeing people.", "I didn\u0092t tell him. I didn\u0092t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.", "Rach look, I really don\u0092t think that\u0092s such a great\u0085", "Hey!", "No. No. But I\u0092ll go see a normal person movie with ya.", "It\u0092s no Ukrainian film.", "I set her up with this actor on my show.", "No", "Well, I was thinking that it\u0092d probably be okay because Ross hasn\u0092t gone out with Rachel in five years!", "Hey! I\u0092m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I\u0092m not sure. I think they\u0092re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.", "Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?", "Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.", "So what movie do you want to see\u0097And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.", "All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it\u0092s like", "!", "And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?", "Dude! What is going on?!", "Why?", "They go on one date and you\u0092re worried about them getting married?! He\u0092s not you!", "Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?", "What do you mean?", "That\u0092s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!", "Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?", "Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn\u0092t Rachel.", "I know, but I don\u0092t think that\u0092s what she wants.", "That\u0092s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It\u0092s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there\u0092s gonna be a brand new little baby,", "baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?", "Hey, I tell you what. Let\u0092s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!", "No, I said fun!", "Look, I\u0092ll come to the party but I\u0092m not dressing up.", "No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you\u0092re not\u0085", "That hot girl from their wedding?", "Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh\u0097Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from", "\u0097No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.", "(entering) Hey!", "Yes I did! I\u0092m Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?", "Okay. I\u0092m Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)", "When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)", "(sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.", "Yeah.", "Exclusively.", "Catwoman, hands down.", "But between you and Phoebe, I\u0092d have to give the edge to Phoebe.", "Are you kiddin\u0092? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she\u0092s got this crazy temper. She\u0097She\u0092s not standing right behind me is she?", "I\u0092m not sure.", "Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn\u0092t matter.", "I would say, \"Woman, please!\"", "(To Monica) Here comes the temper.", "Okay, here\u0092s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.", "So Ross?", "(To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.", "Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?", "So you think Ross too?", "Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let\u0092s give \u0091em what they came for!", "Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.", "Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.", "Rach?", "(entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We\u0092re waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each other\u0092s hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?", "(laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!", "Or equally weak.", "(to her) You\u0092re a weird lady.", "Hey!", "That\u0092s not so bad.", "Come on! You\u0092re good with kids. They\u0092re just crazy on Halloween. Y\u0092know, they\u0092re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!", "Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas\u0085and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they\u0092re hungry or sleepy. Y\u0092know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)", "(entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?", "(laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.", "All right, well finish your coffee; let\u0092s go.", "To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you\u0092re", "gonna be on TV!", "Oh, you\u0092re switching apartments?", "But Rachel has an apartment.", "She is?", "I guess I didn\u0092t really think about it.", "Hey!", "Oh, okay. I\u0085I ate way too much.", "Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin\u0092 to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.", "I was kinda hoping you\u0092d stay.", "No room? It\u0092s a baby. It\u0092s like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Y\u0092know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it\u0092s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn\u0092t even notice it. Where\u0092s the baby? (Mumbles that it\u0092s over in the corner.)", "I could use a challenge! It\u0092s getting pretty easy.", "I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn\u0092t have to change.", "Y\u0092know I blame Ross for this.", "I\u0092m gonna miss you, you\u0092re the hottest roommate I ever had.", "Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh\u0097Oh look! Here\u0092s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?", "Ahhhhhhhhhhhh\u0085. That-that-that\u0092s really just to show where the baby would go. Y\u0092know why don\u0092t I hold on to him so that there\u0092s no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)", "I\u0092m loud!", "I\u0092m up all night!", "Hello!", "Look, if I\u0092m bringing home a woman who can\u0092t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don\u0092t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we\u0092ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!", "Yeah! All right\u0097Look, I know sometimes it\u0092ll be hard, okay? But, it\u0092ll also be really\u0085really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.", "Ohh!", "I know! I found it on the street.", "Yeah.", "I don\u0092t know.", "Ew.", "Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)", "Isn\u0092t that great?", "It\u0092s a grand tradition!", "This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn\u0092t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!", "Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.", "So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How\u0092s it going?", "Hot?", "I\u0092m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.", "Will you let the lady talk?!", "Yeah!", "(on cell phone) I\u0092m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby\u0085", "So you uh, nervous about getting married?", "Look, look let\u0092s pretend it\u0092s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y\u0092know? Before your wedding. Come on, it\u0092ll be fun.", "How does it feel knowing you\u0092re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you\u0092re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.", "That\u0092s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)", "Uh, that-that\u0092s-that\u0092s me!", "Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.", "Why-why would she go in the bedroom?", "Yeah, that\u0092s one naked hooker!", "Wait! Wait! Maybe she\u0092s a hooker", "a stripper, but she got confused about what she\u0092s supposed to do.", "Maybe Monica\u0092s playing a joke on ya. Y\u0092know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that\u0092s pretty funny.", "I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.", "(on machine) Hey Ross. It\u0092s Joey. There\u0092s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you\u0092d know something about it.", "Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.", "Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh?

It just seems that\u0085if you\u0092re gonna have a roommate, y\u0092know it might as well be the father.", "All right now, so? What do you think?", "Well, I was due.", "Hey.", "Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn\u0092t stand the smell of them.

I proposed.", "Oh that\u0092s right. There\u0092s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.", "I can\u0092t believe you\u0092re not going to propose!", "Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!", "(looking at the ceiling) Ah, it\u0092s beautiful.", "Y\u0092know what you guys? I\u0092m uh, I\u0092m gonna go too. And uh, I\u0092m sorry about everything.", "No, Rach, I should\u0092ve told you sooner. It\u0092s just that\u0085Man! That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)", "(Enters) Hey you guys I\u0092m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.", "(He looks around the room) This isn\u0092t the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)", "Why\u0092re you so tired?", "You know what you should\u0092ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.", "Hey so where\u0092s Ross?", "Is he still mad at us?", "That\u0092s not fair! I can\u0092t do that.", "See this is what I was afraid of, I didn\u0092t think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he\u0092d be over it by now.", "(entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it\u0092s Joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you\u0092re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.", "I said I didn\u0092t technically.", "Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don\u0092t really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?", "I know I should\u0092ve. (Makes quote marks again.) \"I\u0092m sorry.\"", "No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can\u0092t leave) Look, Ross, we have to get past this.", "No, look, I don\u0092t know what else to do. I said I\u0092m sorry!", "You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.", "Why not?\u00a0 You\u0092ll feel better!\u00a0 I\u0092ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.", "A little bit.", "Little bit.", "(excited) A little bit more.", "No, hit me", "Hit me.", "Hit me!", "(interrupting) Hit me, hit me.", "(shouts) Hit me! Hit me!", "I\u0092m sorry! It was a reflex!", "I couldn\u0092t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn\u0092t and Joey punches Ross. \u00a0 Gunther is amused.)", "You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn\u0092t you duck?", "Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we\u0092re there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) \"Oops.\"", "Hey, so how is it?", "Your thumb? That\u0092s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you\u0092re punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.", "You, you want me to help you with that?", "Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what\u0092s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.", "It\u0092s pretty, Okay date of birth?", "Sure, May...tember.", "Occupation? Dinosaurs.", "Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?", "Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.", "Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you\u0092re gonna get together right?", "But you two were supposed to be together.", "Come on, Ross, that didn\u0092t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.", "So?", "Wow.", "Really?", "And you\u0092re Okay with that?", "Hey, for what it\u0092s worth, with Rachel I don\u0092t think you\u0092ll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) \"anybody.\"", "(makes quote marks) \"Thanks.\"", "You know, ah, I\u0092ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it\u0092s not my fault. It\u0092s a natural instinct.", "Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler, he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and just stares at Joey.)", "(impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?", "I *love* my job.", "Rach, these are for you.", "No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.", "Uh-huh.", "And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.", "They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.", "Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?", "Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!", "Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?", "Got ya. (blinks an eye)", "Mine's is to Lilian Myers.", "Hey. So where's Mon?", "And you're not helping?", "You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.", "Yeah, you too.", "How do you think she's doing?", "Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.", "Sure.", "Why not?", "So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.", "Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!", "Yes!", "Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)", "For a walk.", "Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.", "Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!", "Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?", "Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.", "Fine ... mediocre porn", "Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?", "Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after Molly)", "So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.", "Oh, I didn't go to college.", "Molly ... people don't study acting ...", "(upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??", "No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.", "Ok (admits)", "It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!", "Morning, roomie!", "Fifth day's a charm.", "Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?", "She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.", "No, hey, it's been great.", "Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...", "Wow! So, how are you?", "Really?", "Well, actually it...", "Wow, really?", "Sure, I know lots of girls.", "Ooh, names?", "Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?", "I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.", "Why are they doing this?", "You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?", "I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.", "Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.", "Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.", "I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.", "Ooh, that's a great plan!", "Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...", "Hey.", "All right! Who is he?", "She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!", "Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?", "Oh my god, you're right!", "She even reads for pleasure!", "What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?", "I met her at the library. I went in to pee.", "Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.", "Ooh...I hear that's bad.", "Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)", "Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.", "Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.", "Hello?", "Emma? Hey! Hi!", "How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?", "You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!", "Because you two were having sex!", "Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?", "Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.", "Hey, I gotta! Unless...", "Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.", "Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.", "(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.", "Uh-huh.", "It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.", "We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.", "Where?", "Can you believe they're still not here?", "I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?", "We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.", "Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!", "Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)", "(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!", "Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)", "(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)", "Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!", "Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)", "(still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!", "Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...", "Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!", "Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)", "It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.", "Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.", "(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over.", "Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.", "No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!", "No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.", "Make the transfer! (She does so)", "Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.", "But he's the same.", "But he's the same.", "He's the same!", "(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!", "Original or crappy?", "No, sorry haven't seen him.", "It's Monica, ok?", "Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..", "... she's being unreasonable!", "It does?", "Really? She... she loves me?", "Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.", "Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.", "How do you think I got him in the first place?", "(talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.", "I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.", "Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!", "Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?", "Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.", "Right!(he starts to ape her)\"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?\" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)", "I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!", "Also so", "!", "Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!", "Oh, wish me luck!", "Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!", "Hey!", "Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good", "!", "Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?", "Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.", "Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.", "What?", "Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!", "but, but..", "Hey!", "(Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!", "I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?", "And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!", "What?", "Oh...I don't think it's going very well...", "Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...", "A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.", "So...I've never played that!", "Uh...well...just once...with you...", "(looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??", "(approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.", "Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.", "(excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)", "(enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?", "Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.", "It's a one-woman play called \"Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life\".", "You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!", "I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work", "early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.", "(lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.", "(entering the room) Hey!", "What's happenin'?", "Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first", "(yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!", "Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.", "I do it every year.", "I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!", "Yeah...", "Yeah...", "(Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!", "You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!", "(speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!", "Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.", "(sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.", "What party?", "(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...", "(to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)", "(To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.", "Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...", "Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)", "It's a science.", "Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...", "Monica!", "(To Rachel) What have you got there?", "Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?", "(browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.", "(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...", "Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.", "That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.", "Me.", "Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!", "Gotcha.", "Hey!", "Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces \"amonious\"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?", "Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?", "(sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!", "Heeey!", "Come on in, how are ya?", "Can I offer you a drink?", "Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!", "Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)", "Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?", "(looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!", "I know, yeah!", "Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.", "Which one, they all suck!", "(looking puzzled) I don't think so.", "Ross!", "I need to talk to you about Charlie.", "Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.", "No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...", "Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!", "(checking) EH, what do you know!", "Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!", "Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.", "Thanks.", "The Metsss!", "(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!", "Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.", "Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!", "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go", "too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?", "You got to tell me exactly what to do there.", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)", "(gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.", "(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!", "Phonetically? (Looks confused)", "Ok.", "Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\" I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".", "No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means \"you're gonna get eaten by a bear\".", "Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).", "Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)", "Hey!", "(to Charlie) You're ready?", "(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.", "Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.", "So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.", "Oh hey Rach!", "Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.", "Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.", "(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!", "What's the matter, Pheebs?", "Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.", "Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?", "(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)", "Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!", "Bye.", "All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?", "So you're ruling out surrogacy?", "So, I don't have to learn what that means?", "Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?", "Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!", "Hello?", "No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?", "Oh! How's it going?", "What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!", "Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!", "Well, just wake him up!", "Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was", "who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?", "(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the", "level of hotness!", "Then don't go!", "Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!", "(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!", "Mmh-mmh.", "Barbados!", "All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.", "I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)", "(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!", "That... never happens...", "No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called \"The Days of Our Lives\".", "(thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.", "You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??", "Yeah! How", "doin'? Yeah alright!", "Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?", "You really should have been more clear about that!", "Hey!", "Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?", "You could say: \"Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?\" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)", "Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?", "(smiling) Will you wear a thong?", "Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!", "Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...", "No, why?", "Oh man!", "I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)", "Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!", "Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and", "is famous!", "Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)", "Hey guys!", "Damnit!", "Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh!", "teapot?", "It's really gone?", "I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.", "Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.", "Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a \"Galaxy far, far away\"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).", "I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.", "Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.", "(stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!", "Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?", "(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...", "Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)", "In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)", "Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.", "Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?", "But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?", "There it is, you're blushing!", "You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)", "Tell me who it is.", "Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?", "What? Why not? Rach, who can", "not get?", "(eagerly) Yeah, who is that?", "Yeah.", "Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?", "Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...", "Yeah. (they leave)", "Night.", "He said \"erectus\"!", "No, he really said it.", "Erectus?", "Yeah, and", "funny!", "Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it", "ya! (smiles ecstatic)", "(disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...", "(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel!

(Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I\u0092m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there\u0092s no future? Either they\u0092re too old, or they\u0092re too young, and then there\u0092s Pete who\u0092s-who\u0092s crazy about me, and who\u0092s absolutely perfect for me, and there\u0092s like zip going on!

Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!", "Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I\u0092m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?", "I get the dollhouse!", "Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.", "Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.", "Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper\u0092s a little faded, that\u0092s okay. Carpet\u0092s a little loose.

Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)", "Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?", "I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica\u0092s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete\u0092s just doing this because he has a crush on me.", "Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can\u0092t.

Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?", "Does it have to do with Joey?", "Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?", "Does it involve travel?", "Does it involve clogs?", "Clogs.", "Claws?!", "Okay, so it doesn\u0092t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?", "What is it?! What about Pete?", "Okay, I feel like I\u0092m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!", "Okay, I gotta go.

I\u0092m sorry.", "Okay, bye.", "All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)", "I need two. I\u0092m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!", "Really? Who\u0092s number two?", "Bye-bye!", "Joey, what are you doing?! It\u0092s never gonna happen, she\u0092s seeing somebody.", "(to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)", "Uh-huh.", "Phoebe?", "All right.

Where were you?", "You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.", "(entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you\u0092ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn\u0092t healthy.", "Hey! Didn\u0092t you have that outfit on last night?", "Anyway, how did it go with Kate?", "Joey, you had the night!", "When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!", "Did you like learn about her family?", "Yes!!", "Oh!

(Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it\u0092s a little sudden, and it\u0092s a little rushed, and it\u0092s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn\u0092t mean I can\u0092t. Right?

That-that was the problem.", "(joining them) Hey.", "Oh, about five minutes. Right now they\u0092re interviewing his opponent.

Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. (There\u0092s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!", "Phoebe?", "Can you just hold on for one minute?", "Are you alone?", "All right.", "Okay, ready?", "Okay.", "Congratulations!", "Okay! My turn! My turn!", "(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) Yeah.", "(upset) That was a terrible throw!!", "Look at me! My big concern is what\u0092s real?! (Finally realises) Oh my God. We\u0092re really sad, aren\u0092t we?", "This isn\u0092t even my dress.", "I\u0092m changing out of this.", "In like a half-hour?", "Okay, throw it straight this time.", "I\u0092m getting married next!!", "Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn\u0092t you start feeling silly?", "Oh God.", "Hey!", "So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?", "No, seriously.", "Oh my God!", "Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? \u0091Cause I don\u0092t think you have to wear it unless you are!", "Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that he\u0092s gonna call you again.", "Again. Y\u0092know what? I think we all did.", "Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily\u0092s wedding dress into Rachel\u0092s room.)", "Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.", "Oh God! He\u0092s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!", "No-no, Rachel, don\u0092t get it! He can\u0092t see us!", "Rachel?!", "Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?", "Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can\u0092t believe my brother\u0092s getting married! And in London! It\u0092s so romantic!", "Hey!", "I never knew that either.", "We\u0092re hanging out.", "I\u0092m sorry honey.", "Rach, you\u0092re gonna come though aren\u0092t you?", "You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren\u0092t there. Just say you\u0092ll think about it, okay?", "I can't believe he did this.", "You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.", "Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.", "(to Ross) I can't believe you did that.", "(seeing the decision) Nooooo. You\u0092re really not going?", "You don\u0092t have a car. And your license expired.", "That\u0092s also like the tenth time you told us.", "What?", "I thought that was a good thing.", "Hey!", "Yeah, there\u0092s one right under the cabinet.", "Why do you need it?", "What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you\u0092re having a party and we\u0092re not invited?", "Sooo?", "Nooo!", "The baby shower for Phoebe!", "Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?", "Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It\u0092s a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)", "I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!", "Because she\u0092s not gonna get to keep the babies.", "Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she\u0092s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.", "Oh, she\u0092s gonna love that!", "Hi Phoebe.", "Hormones.", "Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That\u0092s great. So how-how are things going?", "Here\u0092s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)", "I\u0092m so glad you liked it.", "What?!", "Oh my God!", "Wait, you can\u0092t have the baby here! I mean I haven\u0092t sterilised it since the guys moved out!", "Rachel, get the book! The book!", "The Bible?!", "How do you feel?", "Some moms do that.", "Aww, sweetie, but it\u0092s not like you\u0092re not gonna have anything. You\u0092re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that\u0092s even better.", "I mean, you\u0092re the one they\u0092re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.", "Yeah.", "Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)", "Oh my God!", "Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)", "Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Traveller\u0092s cheques, check!", "Myself. Y\u0092know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.", "Hey!", "Yep! You got the tickets?", "Okay, if you need the vacuum, it\u0092s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator\u0085", "Yeah, okay, give that a try!", "All right, y\u0092know what? We really are late! Let\u0092s go! Let\u0092s go! Let\u0092s go!!", "Chicken Kiev?", "Yeah, y\u0092know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn\u0092t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) So, I can\u0092t wait to see this place you\u0092re getting married!", "It\u0092s nice.", "(entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.", "They torn it down a few days early.", "(entering) Hey!", "Oh my God!", "Hey!", "(laughs) Yes, I did! And", "are welcome!", "Umm\u0085", "She said that?!", "Why?!", "Oh my God. You\u0092re even dumber than", "am!", "Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?", "Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That\u0092s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.", "Sometimes we were.", "Okay.", "You\u0092ll see.", "And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and\u0085 (Points to Ross) You go.", "Ohh. And I don\u0092t even have a date.", "Hey.", "I know. How could we have let this happen?", "Ugh! Well, y\u0092know, we were away\u0085", "I blame London.", "So look umm, while we\u0092re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?", "Only here.", "I\u0092ll meet you there in two minutes.", "(impatiently) Now?", "Oh, I-I don\u0092t know.", "Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)", "Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)", "Wait. Rachel, no, he\u0092s married. Married! If you don\u0092t realize that, I can\u0092t help you.", "Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?", "Why?!", "Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn\u0092t eat meat until she has the babies!", "That\u0092s true.", "Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!", "Yes, I want to change. And why-why don\u0092t you go down and get us a table?", "(elbows him) Fifteen minutes.", "Great\u0085", "But my clothes are\u0097ohh! (They both leave.)", "No time for that!", "Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It\u0092s", "!", "You really think this is okay?", "Oh, it\u0092s so beautiful. Ohh! Y\u0092know, I-I don\u0092t know if I feel right about this.", "Okay!", "You didn\u0092t find her?", "Yeah, I think you should keep looking!", "Or 45.", "Well, it\u0092s getting late.", "Ugh, y\u0092know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.", "I know, I\u0092ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don\u0092t you think?", "Y\u0092know, maybe it\u0092s best that we never got to do it again.", "I\u0092m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I\u0092ll see you there in a bit?", "I know!", "Phoebe, I did not have sex.", "Well, we certainly are alone.", "Right. Umm, listen since we\u0092re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross\u0092s mother\u0085", "Well, an-anyway, I just\u0097that night meant a lot to me, I guess I\u0092m just trying to say thanks.", "(laughs) That\u0092s okay.", "And you\u0092re cute too.", "Okay.", "That counts!", "You look cute in bubbles.", "Chicken? I could eat some chicken.", "Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?", "Bodington's!", "Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.", "No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.", "Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!", "I'll do it!", "Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.", "Honey, sweetie, by the edges.", "Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)", "Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!", "Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.", "If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.", "(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember?", "is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.", "You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.", "We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.", "What happened?", "See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!", "What took you so long?", "Oh, good.", "Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.", "(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.", "What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall", "the trap?!", "I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?", "(Gasps) What?!! You", "tell him that!!", "I make the decisions, and I say no.", "You can't fire me.", "make", "decisions and I say, \"I'm", "fired!\" Ha!", "Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!", "Rachel locked the door.", "Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!", "Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?", "I really need to talk to you.", "Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?", "Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.", "All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.", "Please!", "Joey, I'm in!", "Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!", "Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)", "Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?", "Come on Rach, let's go.", "No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.", "Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?", "Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)", "Oh my God! You're water broke!", "I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!", "Do you know anything about women?", "That's all right.", "Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.", "Oh man! I did it again!", "What?", "That's what it sounded like.", "Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.", "Umm, why don't you give", "something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.", "Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?", "Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.", "Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I", "go out with him.", "Feeling a little better sweetie?", "Me too.", "(entering with Chandler) Hey!", "(To Phoebe) How are you doing?", "Hello Dan! I'm", "looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!", "Chandler!", "So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?", "Oh, great!", "Bye Dan!", "Great!", "Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.", "I think you're better than you think you are.", "(interrupting) Know when to stop.", "Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.", "I think you're my favorite.", "I don't care.", "Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!", "(In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.", "(pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.", "Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!", "Uh-huh, that one!", "(Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm\u0085 (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.", "But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?", "Vomit tux? Who vomited on\u0097y'know what, what you up to Joe?", "Oh that's great!", "What's wrong with PBS?", "Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don\u0092t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.", "I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?", "Hey!", "That's great!", "What?!", "But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.", "Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.", "Sure!", "Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.", "Great!", "What?! You can't\u0097what did you tell her?", "Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.", "No, you cannot.", "(answering it) Hello.", "Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?", "(Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.", "(entering) Hi Chandler.", "Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.", "", ", fall catalog, Page 27.", "Yeah, so?", "Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.", "Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)", "A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!", "All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.", "Keep talking.", "Really?", "Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my\u0085 When is Joey gonna be home?", "But, I just cleaned the bathroom.", "Yeah. (She takes them off.)", "Okay.", "Ow!", "I know!", "Never done that before.", "(quietly) Hi!", "Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.", "I'm", "getting tired of sneaking around.", "All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.", "Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!", "Wait! What about Joey?", "(entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.", "Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.", "Hey.", "No, she's out shopping.", "Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?", "Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?", "Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles\u0085", "Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.", "Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!", "Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.", "We're switching rooms.", "No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?", "We're switching rooms again.", "This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.", "(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?", "Chandler!", "Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!", "Okay,", "one I like!", "Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?", "Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!", "I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!", "We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?", "What did you say?", "(entering) Hi!", "Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?", "Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.", "Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)", "Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.", "300 dollars?!", "Urghh!!", "Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!", "Maybe I could do it.", "Hey.", "You're not gonna be phased out!", "Hi.", "Yeah, it did.", "What?", "Why, exactly?", "Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than\u0097Ohhh! (They both realize something there.)", "(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.", "Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)", "I'm afraid so.", "Hey!", "Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.", "Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.", "Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!", "Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.", "I know, it's great!", "Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.", "Count in our heads as-as good", ".", "Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!", "Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)", "What?!", "Chandler and", "Okay.", "Sorry.", "(To Chandler) Rachel's at work.", "Hey, what's that?", "What is that?", "(looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.", "So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.", "Now calm down Joey.", "Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?", "Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.", "All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?", "Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!", "We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!", "And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!", "Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!", "We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.", "Yeah.", "Wow! That guy is so rude!", "Well you did a little bit.", "I totally forgive you!", "Yes!", "Hey!", "Crematorium Chris? Sure!", "Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.", "No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.", "God, I feel so guilty about Ross.", "Whatever you decide, whatever you do.", "Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.", "Hey, look at you! Where have you been?", "How did that happen?", "I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.", "Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.", "I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)", "How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!", "Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.", "Oh, Larry.", "Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.", "Larry?", "Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.", "It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.", "Thanks.", "Hmm?", "He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try\u0085", "Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.", "(To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?", "Ohh, fun!", "Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.", "And you're not gonna do that.", "So-so there is no party.", "I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.", "Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.", "You are?", "Okay.", "What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!", "Great. So the ball is in his court?", "Hey!", "I don't know, clean places?", "(looking through the peephole) It's Danny.", "(to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?", "The fake kind!", "We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)", "Okay, great!", "Just go over and say hi.", "Hey, Danny!", "(turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)", "Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)", "(upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.", "I thought there wasn't a ball?", "I think I need a drink.", "Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.", "That's very nice.", "Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?", "Oh, let's not tell this story.", "(entering) Hey!", "Hey, did you get the turkey basted\u0097Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?", "What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?", "Well, get it off now!", "Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!", "Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!", "Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!", "That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.", "Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.", "Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!", "I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!", "Well, I do.", "Yes, it was!", "(interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!", "Hi, Chandler.", "What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)", "So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.", "Well it didn't!", "Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!", "How?", "What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!", "Yeah.", "And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!", "Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?", "What do you mean?", "(excited) I can do that!", "Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.", "Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)", "Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that\u0097(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)", "Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)", "What?! What is it?", "God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!", "Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your", "!", "I didn't", "to cut it off. It was an accident.", "I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!", "Chandler! (Follows him out.)", "Chandler, I said I was sorry.", "Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?", "Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)", "Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)", "I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)", "What?", "You said you loved me! I can't believe this!", "Yes, you did!", "You love me!", "Yeah!", "(entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!", "(inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.", "We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.", "We are! Help us!", "Joey!", "Hey, Phoebe!", "Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)", "Phoebe, you are a bad ass!", "Phoebe?", "Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.", "We're so sorry.", "Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.", "Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)", "I know.", "Ross, are you okay?", "Why?!", "A pill?", "Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?", "(yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!", "(grabbing the picture) Give me that!", "It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!", "Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!", "Oh no!", "Yes it's true.", "I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.", "I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.", "I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.", "(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!", "Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We should have essay questions!!", "You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was", "popular. (Chandler laughs.)", "Danny? You know Rachel? She\u0092s nice. She\u0092s not bad to look at, right?", "Do you want to go out on a date with her?", "Friday\u0092s perfect...She can\u0092t wait.", "(Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!", "I just wanted to see how it's going.", "(Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out.", "Yeah!", "Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)", "Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)", "Hey, what's up?", "Oh, honey, I'm sorry.", "You had no relationship!!", "Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.", "Come on, hurry!", "No.", "No.", "Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)", "Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.", "Hey!", "All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.", "Still, I was quick as a cat.", "Oh, you're kidding.", "(laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.", "Too strong for me?", "You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?", "Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.)", "That was unbelievable!", "Hi, how are you doing Kelly?", "It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can", "appreciate it?", "This is disgusting!", "Oh no, wait! Joey!", "Happy New Year.", "She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.", "Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.", "Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.", "Hi Ben!", "I like 'em.", "I like them a lot.", "It's my New Year's resolution!", "No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.", "Thank you. (Leaves.)", "(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.", "(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big\u0085", "We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.", "Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!", "See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.", "Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.", "Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?", "I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.", "Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)", "Hi, nice to meet you!", "What was that?", "That noise you just made?", "Really? Your work laugh?", "All right, check me out.", "Really?", "Hey, I thought you already had one.", "Hi!", "What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.", "Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.", "Okay. Umm\u0085", "Okay, what's going on with you?", "Well, I-I\u0097there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.", "Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?", "Game!", "Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!", "I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.", "Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.", "They have racquets don't they?!", "I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.", "I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)", "I got it!!", "I can't believe you let them win!", "I was frustrated.", "I was frustrated with you!", "Y'know what really bothers me? Is\u0097it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the \"I'll see you around, Bing!\" \"Not if I see you first, Doug!\" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.", "I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.", "Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!", "My turn? What-what are you talking about?", "What?!", "Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.", "Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big\u0085(Thinks)\u0085ot.", "Mr. Bigot. He tells the most", "jokes.", "Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)", "Oh, none for me. Thanks.", "(To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?", "Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.", "I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.", "(interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.", "Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?", "I thought you could use the help.", "Sorry! I'm just\u0097I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!", "I know! It's just that\u0085ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.", "(entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!", "Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]", "Okay great!", "Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!", "Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.", "Okay.", "I'll get back to my new job.", "I can't", "we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!", "That was a half an hour?", "Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the", "massages!", "It's so good, isn't it?", "Say good-bye to sore muscles!", "(entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.", "Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.", "(to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?", "What?! What honey?", "Oh, did you catch him?!", "All right, let's go say good-bye.", "Well, at least you scared someone.", "Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.", "What are you talking about?", "(indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)", "No he's not!", "What?!", "You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.", "But the minute we start to lie to each other\u0085 (Pauses after she realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.", "No.", "Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me\u0097just say, \"I don't like your massages.\"", "(starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.", "I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.", "(bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.", "Oh my God! You don't know me at all!", "I'm crying here!!", "Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?", "So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?", "Okay. I suck!", "Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.", "You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?", "Okay, now you're even cuter!!", "What?", "What are you talking about?", "That's not possible!", "I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.", "I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.", "This bicep?", "Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.", "Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?", "Okay.", "I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.", "Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?", "Well what did you send?", "Bye!", "Actually, I did!", "Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!", "Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!", "Them?! Who's them?", "Joey!", "Unless\u0085", "Oh man, they think they are so", "messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So\u0085", "(in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!", "Oh yeah!", "All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!", "Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!", "Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!", "Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)", "She's bluffing!", "You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!", "Of course.", "I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)", "Well actually, Ross doesn't.", "What are you doing?!", "Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?", "I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.", "Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.", "But what?", "In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?", "I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?", "Isn't this great?", "Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?", "Are you okay?", "What-what are you doing?", "Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!", "Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.", "Oh and", "know what I want!", "I do not have baby fever!", "Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!", "You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)", "Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?", "I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.", "What?!", "Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)", "(raising her hand) I'm Monica.", "Okay.", "Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!", "No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!", "Chandler, why are you doing this?", "Chandler.", "Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?", "(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how", "this sounds.", "Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!", "Who? Two divorces and Joey?!", "Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.", "Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?", "Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.", "Hey!", "(checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)", "I know.", "Chandler and", "Okay.", "Dream", "Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!", "Dream", "Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but\u0085", "Dream", "Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you.", "Wow!", "Hey.", "Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?", "I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.", "Are you saying I smell bad?", "What's with him?", "(cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!", "Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)", "What is going on with you?", "What was the dream about?", "Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn\u0092t mean that-that you're in love with me!", "No!", "Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.", "Um-hmm.", "Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!", "You become friends after?", "(laughing) That's right.", "Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!", "What about the closeness?", "Who is it?", "Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)", "Did I squeeze it too hard?", "Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?", "Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!", "(joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?", "What happened?", "No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.", "What?", "Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?", "I know it is the best.", "What? It's still going on.", "I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.", "(Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don\u0092t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!", "Oh no, it", "okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!", "You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)", "(entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from", "called, you got a second interview!", "Yes!", "A kiss? What are you talking about?", "He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.", "Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?", "What are you doing?", "(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck", "that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not seeing a movie!", "Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?", "Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?", "Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have", "to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}", "'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!", "So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!", "Phoebe and Gary are", "gonna hear about this at dinner.", "We are the hottest! Huh?", "is hotter than we are! You're the best.", "No, you're the best.", "I", "the best.", "(looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?", "Why?", "What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!", "No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.", "You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?", "Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.", "You didn't!", "The park huh? A public place.", "I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)", "Hi Chandler.", "Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?", "Come on, we", "let them win!", "Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!", "I feel really sad that we're not\u0085really there anymore.", "Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?", "Really?", "That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.", "Yeah. (They hug.)", "Did not.", "Okay, I freaked out a little.", "Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!", "Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.", "I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.", "I would love to do it together!", "It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.", "That doesn't seem fair.", "Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.", "Hey!", "Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)", "All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.", "Oh, we're not doing that. Okay\u0085", "What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!", "(Thinks) Cups.", "And ice!", "Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant\u0085", "Hey! How'd the audition go?!", "Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) \"Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?\"", "You got a callback too didn't you?", "(To Rachel) How did work go?", "You stink!", "No, I'm-I'm serious!", "That's so gross!", "Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)", "(overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!", "Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!", "Y'know\u0085go! Go! Right there! (Points)", "That's the surprise!", "(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!", "So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London\u0085", "Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?", "That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.", "That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.", "(runs over to Phoebe) You have", "to go home!", "You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.", "Great!", "(noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?", "It's a diaper commercial.", "What's goin' on?", "It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.", "It's no big deal, I do it all the time.", "Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!", "Chandler, this actually bothers you?", "What?", "(following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.", "No you didn't.", "Yeah, it's good.", "Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.", "Go on, teach me something about men and women.", "No way!", "Well that's pathetic!", "And this goes for all guys?", "No! You are", "gonna run out and leave her here!", "(entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)", "Yeah, what is it?", "(shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.", "All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.", "Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?", "(angrily) That is", "why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!", "Yes!", "What about these? These look the same?", "Not as each other!", "Hi!", "Yeah.", "Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.", "Oh, honey, the earrings\u0085", "My boyfriend really does have good taste!", "Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.", "Hey!", "Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could", "organize these photos!", "Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know\u0085 And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)", "You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.", "All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.", "I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.", "All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.", "Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around\u0085", "What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!", "(on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!", "I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.", "See if he has ice.", "(does Rachel's) Nooo!", "Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!", "We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?", "I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn\u0092t that give me the right to control him\u0097help him?", "No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.", "Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.", "All right, I guess we should go.", "Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)", "There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!", "Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.", "Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!", "Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a", "military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.", "No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.", "So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?", "(shocked) Oh my God!", "I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?", "I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {", "!", "! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do", "get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral\u0085", "(sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!", "He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!", "Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!", "Ohhhh!", "That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)", "(entering) Hey guys!", "Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter) It was right here, where is it?", "All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!", "Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!", "What?!", "Really?!", "(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)", "Rach?", "You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)", "(shocked) What?!", "I don't want a cat!", "(To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!", "(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!", "He's a dropper!", "Oh my\u0097Oh good God!", "So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?", "Rach, why won't they take it back?", "Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.", "Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.", "So you're moving in with him. What happened?", "Why, do you write him a lot?", "Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!", "Please! I made this game what it is.", "All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?", "All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.", "Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!", "Wow! You made a profit!", "All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!", "It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!", "Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)", "(To Rachel) Wow! It's really red!

We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.", "Really?", "The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!", "Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.", "I know.", "What?", "It's almost our anniversary!", "I got you a present!", "I know, but you have to open it today!

I love you!", "Okay!", "I love the \"I forgot the present\" fake out!", "Oh that's okay. Don\u0092t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.", "Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.", "Really?!", "Great!", "Phoebe, you don't eat animals.", "Who are you talking too?", "I'm so sorry.", "I", "you were not okay with that.", "It meant nothing!

Happy Anniversary!", "No it is not!", "(to the bartender) Thank you.", "I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!", "This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.", "Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.)", "Anybody lose this?

Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I\u0092m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!", "Not any more.", "Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.)

That thing can put someone\u0092s eye out!", "Oh it\u0092s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.", "How are you still single?!", "Good. What made you change your mind?", "Damnit! Y\u0092know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!

I\u0092m just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"", "Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her!

Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?", "Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.", "Of course!", "All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves on) Okay, now did Ross sit", "while he was naked?", "(on phone) Okay, great!\u00a0 Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.)

Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)", "Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn\u0092t.", "(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I\u0092ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)", "Well, um, because mainly, um, they don\u0092t like you. I\u0092m sorry.", "Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you\u0092re really sarcastic, or that, y\u0092know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.", "Look, I know that I should\u0092ve told them. I know I shouldn\u0092t care what they think. I\u0092m sorry.", "You really think that\u0092ll work?", "(hugging Chandler) I don\u0092t think you\u0092ll ever get my parents that drunk!", "Nothing.", "No, sweetie, I-I trust you.", "You\u0092re not gonna mess it up.", "Well, it\u0092s done about two minutes before it looks like that.", "Whoa whoa whoa! Where\u0092re you goin\u0092?", "Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?", "You\u0092re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you\u0092re gonna eat here!", "Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it\u0092s Chandler!", "Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.", "Y\u0092know dad, Chandler is one of Ross\u0092s very best friends!", "Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.", "Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!", "Ross, I can\u0092t believe you\u0092d do that!", "You! It\u0092s not like it\u0092s a big deal! You-you don\u0092t still do it or anything!", "Dad, please don\u0092t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you\u0092re gonna put your feet up, why don\u0092t you sit on the-", "Ross, if you don\u0092t tell them, then I will!", "Really?", "Okay.", "(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It\u0092s good!", "It\u0092s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who\u0092s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.", "(again, lying) I\u0092m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.", "Ross? Let\u0092s go.", "Alright, you know what? That\u0092s it. You\u0092ve had your chance.", "(out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!", "And Dad, y\u0092know that mailman that you got fired? He didn\u0092t steal your Playboys! Ross did!", "Ross hasn\u0092t worked at the museum for a year!", "Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!", "Well actually, I-I didn\u0092t eat mine. It\u0092s still in the bathroom.", "Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It\u0092s about being with the people that you love.", "Oh, here.", "Aw, I\u0092m sorry sweetie that she doesn\u0092t feel the same way.", "Hold it! Are you talking about", "?", "Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!", "We are there!", "What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!", "We are going to", "!", "Oh my God!", "Okay, here comes another camera.", "If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They\u0092ve been taping those people up there all day.", "Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?", "Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He\u0092s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.", "Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren\u0092t wearing underpants?", "Man, this sucks! Y\u0092know if Mom and Dad don\u0092t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who\u0092s gonna be the losers then?", "What?", "Ross, we haven\u0092t done the routine since middle school.", "Was it really that good?", "Okay, let\u0092s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!", "5 6 7 8!", "Yes! (They run over to a platform)", "I know! Hey, you haven\u0092t been practising the routine, have you?", "Me too!", "Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don\u0092t wanna look stupid!", "Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?", "We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled \u0091CUT!\u0092", "Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!", "What? We could do it!", "I can do it, okay? Come on, let\u0092s go. (She and Ross get up)", "I can\u0092t do it! (Ross falls into Monica\u0092s room)", "Honey, we have been through this before!", "You serious?!", "Really?!", "Bye. (Janine exits.)", "I am", "glad you said cooks.", "You got it from", "?!", "Rach, Phoebe hates", ".", "Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.", "It\u0092s gotta be one of a kind. Y\u0092know like umm, y\u0092know uh, what\u0092s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?", "I\u0092m telling\u0097If you put that in her apartment you\u0092ll never hear the end of it.", "I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!", "Yeah.", "So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I\u0092ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.", "Joey, you don\u0092t have too!", "Tomorrow!", "Hey!", "The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.", "What happened to Janine?", "Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!", "(loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?", "Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!", "Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.", "(from the hallway) I do", "like that woman!", "I", "loud!", "Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?", "(loudly) I know!!!", "Well, I\u0092d like to but, (extremely quietly) I\u0092m not sure we have time to go.", "We owe you?!", "We didn\u0092t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, \"No!\")", "Don\u0092t worry about it.", "Absolutely!", "Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)", "(bursting in) I", "it!! Y\u0092know, you\u0092re not so quiet yourself, missy!", "(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let\u0092s go! Right now!", "(to Janine) You\u0092d better hope I don\u0092t see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)", "What did I tell you about the hall?!", "Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.", "Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I\u0092m glad we worked things out.", "Okay.", "Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)", "(hearing that) That\u0092s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!", "(chasing her) You\u0092d better run!", "I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.", "That didn\u0092t work on mom, it\u0092s not going to work on us.", "No.", "Well, you tell a lot of jokes!", "So do you think that these pictures\u0097Are, are they trying to tell a story?", "Well, she\u0092s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.", "Rachel and", "Yeah.", "Okay, I\u0092ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?", "Me neither.", "What?!", "(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.", "It\u0092s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.", "That\u0092s a good idea.", "Do you know what\u0092s a bad idea?", "That\u0092s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?", "It\u0092s coming from the living room.", "(entering) Hey, you guys.", "That is completely untrue. You think I\u0092m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we\u0092re going to go through it point by point!", "I know. Where do you wanna go eat?", "I\u0092m sick of Japanese. We\u0092re not going there.", "All right.", "No, thank you.", "Joey, what are you doing?", "Joey, do you work here?", "Joey, what\u0092s going on. What didn\u0092t you tell us you work here?", "So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?", "Hah!", "Well, then, I\u0092m okay with being high maintenance.", "I am not high maintenance!", "Why do I have to decide?", "I can\u0092t be fair. You\u0092re my boyfriend.", "Okay, Chandler, you go first.", "Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?", "Continue.", "All right, I\u0092ve heard enough. I\u0092ve made my decision.", "You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it\u0092s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn\u0092t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!", "Hi, Chandler. There you are.", "Hey, it\u0092s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don\u0092t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?", "Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.", "Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!", "Ahhh!", "are on my list.", "(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn\u0092t even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right you\u0092re off my list.", "(sits next to him) Phoebe, it\u0092s okay that you don\u0092t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.", "(entering) Hey!", "(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can\u0092t work if I\u0092m sick.", "I\u0092m not sick!! I don\u0092t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!", "(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)", "I don\u0092t need a tissue! I\u0092m fine-d!", "I\u0092m fine-d. I\u0092m fine-d! Y\u0092know, it\u0092s a really hard word to say.", "Rach? (Points to Jill.)", "You bought a boat?", "Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let\u0092s do something crazy!", "Okay, I\u0092ll rest. But y\u0092know if I\u0092m going to bed, then you\u0092re coming with me.", "(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don\u0092t wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn\u0092t work all that well with the big robe.)", "(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)", "I\u0092m with you Chandler! I mean I can\u0092t have sex with a sick person either, that\u0092s disgusting! But I\u0092m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.", "(still sick) Chandler!", "(trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.", "How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.", "Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I\u0092m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)", "I\u0092m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)", "(entering) Chandler, I think I\u0092m sick.", "Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that", "to put on.)", "Come on! I really need your help!", "Fine, I\u0092ll rub it on myself.", "Yeah?", "Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?", "I can\u0092t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?", "Not now, I\u0092m sick!", "What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?", "Okay, if you really wanna have sex\u0085", "Worked like a charm.", "(calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?", "(entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross\u0092s apartment) Is that your sister?", "God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!", "Oh no it\u0092s not, no it\u0092s not. It\u0092s a first date. I\u0092m", "that nothing is gonna\u0085(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)", "Joey we know you steal our food.", "(To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?", "(crying) This is my favorite part.", "Chandler there\u0092s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don\u0092t have to be so macho all the time.", "Yeah you\u0092re right. I don\u0092t know what I was thinking.", "Oh, I\u0092ve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!", "Where were your parents?", "Poor thing!", "You\u0092re jealous of Princess Caroline?", "(noticing the bag Joey\u0092s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?", "Guys, what\u0092s going on?", "That\u0092s Phoebe! Where did you get that?", "This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y\u0092know she had such a terrible childhood.", "Yes, but you are dead inside.", "Wh-what, why?", "Yeah you\u0092re right, we can\u0092t\u0097we shouldn\u0092t watch this.", "(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn\u0092t let him grab it) Y\u0092know maybe a little bit!", "Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?", "Hey sweetie!", "(picking up the book)", "?", "Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.", "Oh that\u0092s so sweet! Look Chandler I don\u0092t care if you can\u0092t cry, I love you.", "Stop it!", "I won\u0092t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)", "Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don\u0092t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won\u0092t matter to me.", "And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you\u0092re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, \"I will always be with you,\" and you still can\u0092t shed one tiny tear, I know you\u0092ll be crying a river inside.", "What is wrong with you?!!!", "What?! You can\u0092t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!", "No you robot!!", "No, I haven\u0092t.", "(To Chandler) Shhhh!!!", "Oh my God! Are-are you crying?", "Bye.", "Oh my God!", "Why did they get divorced?", "And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn\u0092t be dating me, that\u0092s for sure.", "He\u0092s not boring! He\u0092s just-he\u0092s just low key.", "Thanks.", "Oh no! What\u0092s the matter?", "Okay.", "Bye.", "Maybe Joey doesn\u0092t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?", "No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!", "Hey Phoebe! Guess what?", "Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!", "Hey!", "(gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!", "You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!", "Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we\u0092ve seen each other?", "Rach, he\u0092s a friend of ours.", "(getting up) Joey!", "Ohhh!

A lot, a lot!", "Well, y\u0092know it\u0092s none of my business, but aren\u0092t you married?", "Well, you\u0092re not.", "Yeah I can! (Laughs) And don\u0092t think I don\u0092t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)", "(giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, I\u0092m some 30 year old virgin?", "Say it louder, I don\u0092t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!", "It\u0092s not like, I haven\u0092t any opportunities. I mean, y\u0092know, I\u0092m just waiting for the perfect guy. I\u0092m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He\u0092s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.

When? Do you wanna do it with me?", "I was kidding.", "No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?", "Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you\u0092re horrible, how would I know?", "It\u0092s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!", "Absolutely!

I'd say 3 to 4.", "When it's your assistant, I would say never.", "Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he\u0092s obviously depressed.

Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I\u0092d ever been looking for my whole life. And now\u0085here we are\u0085with our future before us\u0085and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don\u0092t want to.

Y\u0092know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.", "Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it\u0092s gonna be.", "Well, there\u0092s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she\u0092s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?", "Are you okay?", "Oh really?!", "(interrupting) Rachel\u0092s really the one who\u0092s pregnant.", "How do you feel?", "Yes! Maybe it\u0092s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?", "You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.", "Okay.", "Oh, wait a minute! Who\u0092s is the father?!", "Oh, come on it\u0092s my wedding! That can be my present.", "Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?", "Ohh come on, I love this song!

I can\u0092t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!", "Hey!", "No! (Pause) But, they\u0092re callin\u0092 out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn\u0092t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?", "A tiny salt shaker!!!", "Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.", "Good. Okay, I\u0092m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.", "Whew. Although y\u0092know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean\u0085 I guess y\u0092know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?", "Or this one!

Joey and Ross don\u0092t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe\u0092s pregnant.", "Wow. Y\u0092know it is so weird. I mean, you\u0092re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what\u0092s gonna happen.", "What was that bam?", "Who\u0092s David Lynn?", "No! No! I shouldn\u0092t have even opened these!

I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!", "Yeah. What is that?", "Hey! How\u0092d it go?", "So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?", "What?!", "Great! We\u0092re hangin\u0092 in the kitchen!

The only thing I couldn\u0092t find though was your Speedo.", "Hey!", "Thank you.", "This is so great! And I\u0092m gonna be your baby\u0092s aunt!", "Yeah, but I\u0092m the only one related by blood.", "Well, what were you gonna say?", "Hey! Good luck!", "Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.", "I didn\u0092t think you could keep it a secret.", "They\u0092re kissing let\u0092s just go around them.", "I\u0092m in love too!

I almost didn\u0092t hear you, because y\u0092know I\u0092m just so in love with my new husband. We\u0092re on our honeymoon.", "Oh no, you see we\u0092re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?", "You see, if we\u0092d gone around them like I said, we\u0097She would\u0092ve given us those tickets. Damnit!", "Look at that! Look at that! They\u0092re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?", "Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)", "Oh my God! Oranges!", "Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!", "I can\u0092t believe we\u0092re here.", "What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)", "No!! You have been screwing us all day!", "Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you\u0092re not the only ones on your honeymoon!", "What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!", "Well do something! Get in there!", "Yeah! Do that!", "No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don\u0092t hear anything! Come on!", "You\u0092re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to necklace of shells he\u0092s wearing.)", "Hi sweetie!", "Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.", "No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!", "Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.", "I know.", "This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.", "We didn\u0092t get anything for anyone.", "That you can have.", "It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you\u0092re having a baby!", "Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)", "All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y\u0092know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?", "Do you still wanna call \u0091em? I wanna call \u0091em.", "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?", "(on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)", "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It\u0092s the deli again!", "(hangs up) I don\u0092t think this number\u0092s right!", "What?! People don\u0092t do that!", "They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?", "And you\u0092ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!", "Yeah, definitely.", "I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.", "Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don\u0092t give out fake names.", "I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.", "(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)", "What about my questions?", "Oh, I\u0092m sorry. Was that another joke?", "Hell yeah!!!", "(taking Rachel\u0092s hand) Sweetie okay. It\u0092s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I\u0092m fine.", "I know.", "You used the Europe story!", "(on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane?

I am", "putting a dollar in the jar.", "Hi!", "I\u0085I have to fire him.", "Because he\u0092s terrible! Okay, he\u0092s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!", "Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.", "(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!", "I paid to have this done.", "Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has", "to go!", "No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, \"Ha-ha! Gotcha!\"", "Why not?!", "What?! You said he was sweet!", "Just don\u0092t pick up your phone.", "What? So now I\u0092m not allowed to fire him?", "Okay well then, I\u0092ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.", "Okay well, then we\u0092ll both do it today and he\u0092ll just have to deal with it!", "What do you mean?", "I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.", "Hey.", "Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?", "Oh my pleasure.

Really?!", "No you\u0092re fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?", "What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!", "Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y\u0092know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?", "Oh my God, Phoebe!", "You\u0092re getting a crush on your sister\u0092s fianc\ufffde.", "I can\u0092t answer that!

Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one\u0092s gonna fight in this apartment.", "(To Chandler) Look honey, you don\u0092t have to do this, okay? It\u0092s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You\u0092re loyal, you\u0092re honest, and you have integrity! That\u0092s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!", "(To Phoebe) Oh God!", "Chandler\u0092s making his sex face.", "Look, I wanted to tell I\u0092m-I\u0092m sorry you lost.", "(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.", "Chandler please!", "Let\u0092s go big bunny!", "Hey.", "Oh my God!

And nagging works!", "Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?", "Well then who?", "(shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then\u0085", "Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!", "Did she really say that?", "Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.", "Well, usually when I\u0092m this anxious, I clean!", "Oh well umm, I make it myself! It\u0092s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is\u0085y\u0092know what? We", "met.", "(To Chandler) I love her.", "Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)", "She stole my jeans!", "I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!", "Don\u0092t you see? It\u0092s the perfect crime!", "I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!", "I guess.", "Fine. I\u0092m just glad I didn\u0092t give her my secret ingredient.", "Yeah! (Laughs.)", "Nice jeans!", "Oh.

That\u0092ll really work up your appetite for lunch.", "Hello.", "I\u0092m sorry. I\u0092ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?", "Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.", "Because I put my head between her legs.", "They\u0092re my pants!", "No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.", "Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She\u0092s wearing my bra!", "My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!", "Here\u0092s the plan! Okay?

Did you take my bra too?!", "The pink one with the flowers?!", "Sounds about right.", "(recognizing him and panicking) No you don\u0092t!", "I\u0092m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!", "Ugh, I", "giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!", "(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you\u0092re gonna have a bachelor party.", "Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!", "Come on! Come on, it\u0092ll be fun! It\u0092ll make me feel so much better.", "So don\u0092t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a\u0085a two month anniversary present.", "Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!", "Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?", "Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl\u0092s number.", "My husband.", "She\u0092s a stripper.", "Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?", "Oh my God Stu! I-I can\u0092t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she\u0092s a hooker?", "(entering quickly) She\u0092s a hooker! She\u0092s a hooker! She\u0092s a\u0085 (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the hooker\u0092s hand.)", "I swear I didn\u0092t know she was a hooker! I mean wh\u0097Did you let her smoke in here?", "Y\u0092know what? I\u0092m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you\u0092re gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)", "What?", "Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I\u0092ll take them off. (Goes to do so.)", "Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)", "(entering) Oh good you\u0092re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o\u0092clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?", "He was in Ross\u0092s class\u0085marching band\u0085kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.", "No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven\u0092t thought about him in a long time\u0085 (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Will\u0092s, Will\u0092s here on business and he didn\u0092t have a place to go so I invited him here.", "Oh, and by the way, he\u0092s lost a bunch of weight.

I still love Chandler.", "All right okay, just so you know, I\u0092m not gonna make a turkey this year.", "Well Phoebe doesn\u0092t eat turkey\u0085", "All right! Okay, it\u0092s just Phoebe. Will\u0092s still on a diet, Chandler doesn\u0092t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel\u0092s having her aversion to poultry.", "Anyway, it just doesn\u0092t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It\u0092s a lot of work.", "All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just\u0097there\u0092s gonna be a ton left over.", "All right, you\u0092re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?", "Hey, isn\u0092t weird to think about how next year at this time they\u0092ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachel\u0092s! But good to know where you\u0092re at!", "Hey!", "You too!", "Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he\u0092s really into the game so I don\u0092t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)", "I\u0092m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.", "No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We\u0092re not at a barn dance. You\u0092ve gotta\u0097you wanna fold them like swans.

(Sets down a huge turkey.)", "About nineteen pounds.", "(To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.", "Oh Will. But you-you\u0092ve worked so hard\u0085", "Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.)", "I swear I didn\u0092t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?", "Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.", "", "started that?!", "Everyone at our school heard it!", "I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.", "Joey, you don\u0092t have to finish that.", "Oh! Me too!", "That\u0092s not totally true.", "Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.", "It\u0092s true?!!", "Didn\u0092t she walk with a cane?", "All right, listen you\u0092re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a", "!", "And Ross, if it weren\u0092t for Rachel\u0092s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!", "Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.", "Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you\u0092ve been through so much since then. And right now you\u0092ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can\u0092t you just let this go?", "Well Joey, we\u0092re all\u0085we\u0092re all very proud of you.", "Yeah, you want some?", "Hey! So what do you think?", "Yes! Now, they\u0092re a little more than I normally spend on boots\u0085or rent (Shows him the receipt.)", "I know.", "I\u0092m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, \"Oh, these are way too expensive for you.\"", "Hey.", "They\u0092re mine!", "Honey, I\u0092m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I\u0092m going to wear them all the time. You\u0092ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?", "Nice try; I\u0092m keeping the boots.", "Hey guys!", "Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)", "See Chandler? I\u0092m getting a lot of use out of them already! They\u0092re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants\u0085", "(almost crying) They hurt so much!", "The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!", "I can\u0092t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I\u0092d wear them all the time, I just can\u0092t give them away!", "I can\u0092t do that either! The soles\u0092 are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.", "(standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!", "Oh nothing I\u0092m just\u0097just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from before and stretches.)", "Honey, we don\u0092t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?", "I-I don\u0092t-I don\u0092t think that I\u0092m gonna wear the boots tonight.", "Well y\u0092know, I\u0092m just-I\u0092m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!", "Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don\u0092t really go with it.", "Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I\u0092ll wear the boots. In fact, I\u0092ll go into my room right now and y\u0092know try the outfit on.", "Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying \u0091ow\u0092 with laughing.)", "Yeah! I didn\u0092t know there would be dancing. That was a", "surprise!", "Oh no, we can\u0092t walk!", "Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?", "I can\u0092t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!", "Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They\u0092re killing me! One toe at a time!", "How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?", "Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. (She starts taking them off.) Ah\u0085Ooh\u0085Oohh\u0085Ohh\u0085Oh God\u0085Ohh\u0085Oh\u0085Ohh\u0085Ohhhh\u0085", "(notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!", "My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?", "Okay, I\u0092m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.", "Well I don\u0092t have them either. Where are they?", "Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!", "Okay, I\u0092m never gonna wear them again. I just didn\u0092t get a chance to say goodbye.", "Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.", "(to the boots) Bye boots\u0097Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)", "Yes, hi.", "No leg-chewing for us sir.", "I can\u0092t think of anything we\u0092re doing. (Quietly) Why can\u0092t I think of anything we\u0092re doing?", "Okay, I\u0092ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know, we\u0092re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?", "That\u0092s because he wasn\u0092t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.", "Why did you do that?", "Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.", "Hey, I could\u0092ve had you if I wanted you.", "You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?", "Like asking her to move in with you?", "Making her a mixed tape?", "All right. Have you said, \"I love you?\" You could say, I love you.", "That is a slap in the face.", "Hi Roger.", "Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he\u0092ll have sex with you.", "From the tequila factory?", "Come here. I can breath through my mouth.", "I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?", "(interrupting) I love it! It\u0092s huge!! Let\u0092s open it! Open it!! (Monica rips open the paper.)", "Oh my God!", "Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.", "All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn\u0092t move.)", "Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like\u0097Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!", "Well I-I really don\u0092t remember the name of it.", "Well, you just\u0097you put a quarter in and y\u0092know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.", "Don\u0092t feel bad for me! I won like every time!", "Okay, I\u0092m next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don\u0092t! Don\u0092t start another game! I said I\u0092m next! Phoebe!", "Chandler! Phoebe\u0092s hogging the game!", "You only think it\u0092s stupid because you suck at it.", "No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don\u0092t you go home and wait for the thank you card?", "Okay. Phoebe that\u0092s it. Come on, get out\u0097out of the chair. Get out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can\u0092t move her.) Oh come\u0085Phoebe!", "Hey.", "Well it clearly wasn\u0092t showering or shaving.", "Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played", "while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!", "What is the matter with your hand?", "Chandler, why would you do that?", "You think this is clever?", "Hey wait a minute, this one isn\u0092t dirty.", "Ah, well if you don\u0092t clear this off, you won\u0092t be getting one of those from me. But Ben\u0092s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can\u0092t be there.", "Chandler! He\u0092s seven; he\u0092s not stupid.", "All right, look I\u0092m just gonna unplug it.", "Honey you-you got to beat your scores!", "All right fine. Fine, I\u0092ll do it. I\u0092ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.", "Okay, I got that. I\u0092ll escape over there. I\u0092ll come back over here. All right, come on", ". It\u0092s got\u0097Right\u0097(She dies.)

No problem.", "Okay.", "Here you go.", "Okay.", "What?!", "Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.", "Yes! Exactly.", "(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)", "Phoebe, I can explain!", "Well umm, Alexandra has been\u0085", "Phoebe, don\u0092t get upset!", "Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don\u0092t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)", "No, it doesn\u0092t say where it came from. Where would we return it?", "Why don\u0092t we just find a place for it?", "No! That\u0092s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?", "Oh, okay. Here, why don\u0092t you let me do it?", "No reason. I-I keep private things in there.", "Feminine stuff.", "Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you\u0092ll let it go.", "Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)", "Well it\u0092s\u0085I mean I\u0092d just\u0097I\u0092d be self-conscious. You\u0092re my friend; I\u0092d be naked.", "That\u0092s different, we were roommates! And when?!", "Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.", "Okay, if it means that much to you\u0085", "Dinosaurs.", "Yes.", "Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!", "No. Ooohh\u0085", "(in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!", "Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that\u0092s it! That\u0092s it! Right there! Oh!

That massage felt so good!", "So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?", "Okay.", "What?", "What\u0092s going on?", "What? (Laughs.)", "What?! You\u0092re crazy! There\u0092s nothing sexual about the noises I make!", "Oh my\u0097This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I\u0092m never gonna get massaged again!", "Really?!", "Are you sure?", "I guess.", "(entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!", "Oh no! You weren\u0092t supposed to see this!", "No Chandler, you don\u0092t understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for", ", an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know.

And even if he did you have no idea how she\u0092d react.", "Joey\u0085he\u0092s not even thinking about going after Rachel!", "No! All he\u0092s thinking about is how you\u0092re taking this! I mean, listen it\u0092s totally freaking him out. He\u0092s talking about moving to Vermont.", "He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.", "Honey I can\u0092t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don\u0092t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you\u0092re still his friend.", "All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.", "Hi!", "So, what have you guys been doing?", "I know! What is this, 1985?!", "Not really.", "So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?", "Oh my God! That\u0092s my restaurant, I\u0092m the chef there.", "No!", "Oh, I\u0092d like a latte.

I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese\u0097Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries\u0085 (Breathlessly) And pate.

You\u0092ve been acting weird all afternoon.", "Jeez! What is with you?", "All right, what\u0092s going on?", "Chandler, you don\u0092t believe in soul mates?", "I don\u0092t believe in soul mates either.", "No. I don\u0092t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.", "No, I\u0092ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?", "I know.", "Joey, you", "to talk to her!", "Hey Rachel!", "I don\u0092t see him. Hey! Maybe he\u0092s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)", "What\u0092s up?", "We were playing a game.", "Sure.", "(To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?", "Honey, you gotta talk to her.", "Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they\u0092re hungry.", "This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it\u0092s weird, it\u0092s awkward, but you gotta at least try.", "Okay, I\u0092m done. Read mine.", "(stunned) I-I\u0092m the head chef. I-I can\u0092t get promoted.", "You mean your pink shirt?", "No, I-I haven\u0092t seen your pink shirt.", "Tea gives Phoebe the trots.", "Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?", "Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?", "Where is the James Taylor CD?", "Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we\u0092re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.", "Hmm, I don\u0092t know. We really have to talk this through.", "Okay, I-I\u0092m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.", "Yeah, like I don\u0092t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.", "Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the", "soundtrack? Really?", "Uh I really don\u0092t know what to tell you Rach, I really don\u0092t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.", "Yeah Joey she\u0092s\u0085Rachel\u0092s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow!

The work problem?", "Chandler and", "What?!", "You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!", "Chandler has two copies of", "!", "That\u0092s not your regular dry cleaners.", "What?!", "Don\u0092t worry Phoebe, you\u0092re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.", "Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like", "for me. I\u0092m-I\u0092m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)", "(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?", "Yeah.", "(To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?", "Yeah, I\u0092d really like to.", "Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it\u0092s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I\u0092m going to make them cry.", "No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \"God, your brother.\" Know what they\u0092ll say this year? \"God, you\"", "Really you can do that?", "Oh I\u0092m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)", "It\u0092s a dead dog. That\u0092s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.", "The good stuff, huh?", "You got a present for my parents. That\u0092s so sweet.", "What?!", "That\u0092s my old dog. He passed away years ago.", "It\u0092s out on the island. It\u0092s in Massapequa.", "Okay, I got my note cards.

Those two will never know what hit \u0091em. I can\u0092t wait. They\u0092re going to be crying so hard. They\u0092re going to be fighting for breath.", "Okay it\u0092s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I\u0092m going to do it.", "No, no it\u0092s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don\u0092t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I\u0092m-I\u0092m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can\u0092t because she\u0092s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she\u0092s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in", "? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn\u0092t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching", "these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesn\u0092t get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Here\u0092s to mom and dad! Whatever!", "Okay that\u0092s it. I give up. At mom and dad\u0092s 40", "anniversary, you\u0092re the one giving the speech.", "Oh, come on.", "(starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?", "Hey!", "How cool is this?! We know three down! I\u0092m touching three down!

You\u0092re doing great!", "Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)", "You can\u0092t say that!! You-you don\u0092t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn\u0092t...bend that way. So... (Looks at Joey.)", "You slept with her didn\u0092t you?", "Hey!", "Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.", "Oh my God, your mother!", "Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.", "Well it wasn\u0092t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!", "(interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!", "Okay, y\u0092know what? Don\u0092t worry, okay? We\u0092ll take care of it. We\u0092ll call her. Just go home and get ready.", "Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.)

(Calls Mrs. Green again.)", "You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!", "Hi!", "Yes, thank you so much. And again, we\u0092re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.", "She\u0092s still mad.", "Phoebe, Sandra\u0092s mad at you too. It-it doesn\u0092t bother you?", "Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.", "What?", "I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.", "That\u0092s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don\u0092t want her to live with you. Do", "take no for an answer!", "(To Phoebe) This is great! Now she\u0092s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y\u0092know what? And I\u0092m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.", "Yes! Yes!

It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn\u0092t on purpose! But what you\u0092re during to me now is just plain spiteful!", "That\u0092s right! Maybe it\u0092s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady\u0085old lady\u0085lady!", "So whenever you\u0092re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day!

Well\u0085 (Feeds him a spoonful of what she\u0092s cooking.) I\u0092m getting my revenge!", "No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.

Umm, I\u0092m Monica Geller, I\u0092m the chef at Alessandro\u0092s.", "I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.", "Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?", "I can.", "Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.", "Monica.", "Okay. (Does so.)", "Oh no! I don\u0092t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it\u0092s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.", "I-I-I\u0092m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn\u0092t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?", "That\u0092s right.", "Y\u0092know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)", "Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and I\u0092m sorry, but I don\u0092t care.", "Joey! I\u0092m so proud of you!", "Excuse me? He doesn\u0092t even know what he\u0092s doing!", "I do! I\u0092m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax! It\u0092s not a courtroom drama!", "I\u0092m-I\u0092m sorry, it\u0092s just that umm\u0085 Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro\u0092s, and umm I just got a really bad review\u0085", "You do?", "Oh, I\u0092m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?", "Okay then, I don\u0092t stink.

Want to feel good about yourself?", "Okay.", "Are we gonna take a limo?", "Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!", "What are you doing here so early?", "Well, well Ross didn\u0092t care enough to be here, so I think he\u0092s out. You snooze you lose.", "Well then somebody\u0092s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.

I\u0092ll bet you that she\u0092ll have it by this time tomorrow.", "Okay, how much?", "How about fifty bucks?", "Damnit! Damnit!! Here\u0092s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)", "Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!", "Okay.", "She\u0092s in the bathroom.", "I\u0092m actually with her on this one.", "Hey!", "What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?", "Well what is it? What is it? If it\u0092s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.", "Do it!", "I\u0092m just saying it\u0092s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!", "All right, let\u0092s be practical, if Ross isn\u0092t willing to do it, he\u0092s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler\u0097Chandler is good!", "Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.", "Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you\u0092re gonna have the baby and I don\u0092t want to lose again!", "Wait a minute! Now I\u0092m betting against all three of you?", "Oh, okay!", "Two hundred.", "That\u0092s it. I\u0092m done. I don\u0092t care when the baby comes, no more betting.", "Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh.

Did you guys walk?", "Hey, you wanna see something?", "Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?", "Listen uh, I-I\u0092ve been doing some thinking, and I don\u0092t know whether it\u0092s because we\u0092re here or Rachel\u0092s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.", "(freaking out) What-what-what\u0092s that now?!", "What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we\u0092re ready to have a baby now?!", "Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!", "Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) \u0091Cause I", "ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.", "That\u0092s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!", "Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!", "What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?", "What?", "We are pretty good.", "Well maybe I\u0092m ready now. I mean, it\u0092s a little scary, but maybe it\u0092s right.", "What?!!", "So we\u0092re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?", "Okay, hold on a sec.", "Yeah.", "Well, we could start trying. Now.", "No, not here. Maybe here.", "And it\u0092s so clean!!", "I think we found a place.", "Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?", "Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.", "Okay. Let\u0092s hurry\u0097Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right!

Fertilize me!", "Does that sound like Janice?", "Hey!", "I can\u0092t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?", "Oh my God! She\u0092s amazing. Oh, oh I\u0092m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!", "What\u0092s the matter?", "It\u0092s okay honey, you\u0092ll find a name.", "Yeah, I\u0092ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.", "Umm, okay. If it\u0092s a boy it\u0092s Daniel.", "I don\u0092t want to say.", "Okay. It\u0092s Emma.", "Take it.", "It\u0092s clearly an Emma.", "Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y\u0092know, nothing goes with Bing. So I\u0092m screwed. I mean\u0085 (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that\u0092s you. You\u0092re our little Em. Oh what\u0092s that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!", "I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.", "(entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who\u0092s here!", "Oh, Aunt Liddy\u0092s coming? That means we get five dollars each!", "About what?", "Isn\u0092t she beautiful?", "I want a baby.", "Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it\u0092ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet\u0092s still available?", "Deal!", "Oh, I still can\u0092t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn\u0092t make it to", "of piano recitals, but", "he sees!", "Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?", "It wasn\u0092t fun?!", "The truth is, Dad, we\u0092re-we\u0092re trying.", "Yeah, we\u0092re trying to get pregnant.", "Well, that\u0092s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.", "Daddy?!", "Daddy! I don\u0092t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.", "I don\u0092t feel good right now.", "Hey.", "Well, now\u0092s a good time. I\u0092m on my way to have my ears cut off.", "What?", "Is he crazy?! You just had Ross\u0092s baby!", "What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross\u0092s baby! It\u0092s-it\u0092s so inappropriate. No, it\u0092s worse than that. It\u0092s wrong. It\u0092s\u0085 It is bigger than mine!

Hey dad!", "Ok, I don\u0092t wanna be negative so I\u0092ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.", "(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.", "Honey why don\u0092t you go lie down.", "Phoebe did the signs!", "Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.", "Wow, he\u0092s really not letting this go, is he?", "Breaks your heart doesn\u0092t it", "Alright here\u0092s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.", "It worked!", "Umm, she Rach, not it, she.", "Oh my god, I am losing my mind.", "Try feeding her again.", "I know, that\u0092s why I said again!", "Hey.", "Okay what\u0092s up", "Oh yeah (smiles).", "What? Who says that?", "What\u0092s going on?", "Excuse me?", "(stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!", "Chandler, I don\u0092t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!", "Are you trying to tell me that we\u0092re moving to Oklahoma, or that you\u0092re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?", "Thank you.", "Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.", "About a week and a half.", "Rach, try holding her a different way.", "You\u0092re just new at this, it\u0092ll get better, think about your first day at work.

Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!", "I can\u0092t believe it!\u00a0 She\u0092s asleep!\u00a0 I got her to go to sleep! \u00a0 I have actual magical powers!", "Yes I did, I\u0092m Monica, Super Aunt", "Yes I am!!", "Say what?", "(stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!", "What?", "Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep", "No.", "(loudly) What!?", "(comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!", "I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.", "It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!", "It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.", "(shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??", "No!", "Come on Ben.", "Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.", "(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)", "Yeah, is that okay?", "No.", "Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.", "So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?", "Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.", "Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?", "Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?", "What does she do there?", "She did WHAT?", "*What*??", "Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.", "Okay.", "Okay!", "Merry Christmas.", "Really?", "Well, not anymore.", "I know, I just thought it would be fun.", "Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.", "Okay!", "(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?", "This doesn't feel weird!", "You're a really good kisser.", "Hm-hmm!", "Wow! You are really fast!", "We're gonna see each other naked.", "Do you wanna do it at the same time?", "One!", "Two!", "Eh, we weren't that close anyway!", "Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.", "I think you're better than you think you are.", "(interrupting) Know when to stop.", "Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.", "I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.", "You're so efficient. I love you!", "No-no-no, wait! We need something old!", "That'll work!", "Okay, now we just need something borrowed!", "That's stealing!", "Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)", "Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.", "Eh, you work for that.", "You do?!", "Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?", "You thought about that?", "How many kids were we gonna have?", "What else did you think about?", "(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.", "No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.", "Uh-hmm.", "I love you. (They kiss.)", "\"Wendy\" is a fat girl name.", "Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?", "What are you doing here?", "But I thought if you left, you get fired.", "What?", "Oh my god!", "No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!", "You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?", "Would you stop staring at her?", "What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.", "Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.", "They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.", "(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)", "Hey Rach!", "Ready for your birthday lunch?", "Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?", "You were just being so nice to him!", "Right there! That was so fake!", "Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.", "Does he?", "Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?", "Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)", "Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!", "So this is what a stroke feels like.", "Hey!", "No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?", "Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).", "Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.", "(from inside) Again, you're welcome.", "Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)", "Hey!", "Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?", "Oh my god.", "Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...", "You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!", "Oh, it's perfect.", "Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.", "Yeah.", "No, it's not.", "Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.", "Okay.", "Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.", "Chandler!", "We're okay. I'm still ovulating.", "So, let's do this.", "Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.", "Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.", "Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?", "Canoodling?", "I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...", "I guess you're right.", "But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?", "She's asleep. Chandler?", "What are you doing?", "She's asleep.", "Yes, but we have to be fast.", "Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.", "Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.", "Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?", "Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.", "Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.", "Hey, did you stop by here?", "Oh my god, then...", "Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!", "Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just \ufffd she loves it when I'm dramatic.", "No, we weren't!", "No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!", "Unless what?", "Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?", "Ok, you got it!", "Really? If that's what you want...", "Damn it! Rookie mistake!", "Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) \"gay as the day is long\"?", "But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)", "(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.", "What are you doing?", "Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?", "What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!", "Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.", "And now your cell.", "This is your cellphone?", "This is your current cellphone?", "Phoebe, where's your purse?", "No, no! Give it to me!", "Give it to me!", "I'll go in there.", "Phoebe come here", "Haha!", "Haha!", "So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.", "Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.", "Who's that? (goes to open door)", "(To Mike) What are you doing here?", "Phoebe!", "Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?", "Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!", "(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!", "Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.", "Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).", "Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)", "I've been pretty good!", "Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!", "You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!", "Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.", "(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!", "Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!", "Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!", "Excuse me?", "Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.", "You didn't hear the speech!", "Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!", "You're... weird!", "Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!", "Damn it!", "And I blame you too.", "Hi, glad you could come.", "So, did you know Ross well?", "(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.", "I look like a man??", "You are married though.", "Hey!", "So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?", "Well you", "! We're booked solid for the next month!", "Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!", "Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.", "Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!", "Why don't you take Ross?", "No, not if their room has two beds!", "Thank you!", "Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...", "Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.", "What musician?", "What are you doing here!", "Great!", "Listen Phoebe...", "You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...", "This is kind of a classy place.", "Yeah.", "Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.", "Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?", "What do you think brought than on?", "A love scene? With who?", "Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.", "I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.", "Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.", "It was hard!", "Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.", "Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.", "I didn't say your songs were not good enough.", "Tiny portions?", "Phoebe, it's not about quantity.", "Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.", "Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.", "You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.", "Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.", "Ok, you have to stop playing now.", "Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!", "(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)", "Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).", "Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)", "Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)", "I'm sorry...", "ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?", "(without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!", "It sounds interesting!", "Yeah.", "No, I don't think it ever works. Why?", "No, no, Rachel?", "Who do you wanna fool around with?", "(whispering) You can't!", "In the hall.", "You wanna fool around with Joey?", "Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?", "Who, who are they?", "Both of them?", "Which one?", "Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.", "What the hell are you cooking!", "Hey!", "What's so bad about that?", "(fingering her elbow): Ross?", "(to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?", "(to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.", "(to Ross) So, did you two have fun?", "And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud)", "!! (Charlie looks at her)", "Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?", "You're not sick!", "Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??", "You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!", "Ok, what is this?", "(aloud) WHAT?", "Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!", "The game's over! Take off your robe!", "Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!", "(Yells after him) I love you!", "Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.", "(Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.", "(Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!", "(to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".", "Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!", "(yelling after him) We will!!", "(to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!", "I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?", "Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)", "That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).", "Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!", "Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.", "You really liked it?", "Oh really!", "No!", "So I got it when I was 13...", "Hey!", "No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.", "That's different! I was drunk and stupid!", "What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?", "Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.", "And I can't stop you.", "Oh, you're so wonderful.", "It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.", "Yes Rachel, why", "you care so much?", "Hey!", "Hey, what's this?", "Oh, you can't show Phoebe this!

Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh!

We bought bras! We bought bras.", "Ben, dinner!", "Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)", "I licked my arm, what?", "So?", "You won't even taste it?", "Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?", "Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.", "Come on. It doesn't taste bad.", "You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that.

It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.", "Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!", "No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!", "Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi!

Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....", "All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay.

I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.", "Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?", "No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while.

Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.", "So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.)

Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!", "I will find a selfless good deed!

Sure!", "Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That\u0097this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.

What's going on?", "Oh my God!", "(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?", "Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!", "Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.", "Hey!", "No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.", "All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.", "Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?", "Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.", "Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!", "Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.", "What am I sitting on?", "(taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!", "Umm,", ". I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.", "Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took!

You didn't even read it!", "I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.", "Would", "care to venture one?", "Are you just repeating what", "saying?", "Okay then.", "Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!", "Yeah?", "Hi!", "You didn't read this one either?!", "What?", "No! You should've read it yourself!", "Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.", "Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.", "Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.", "(smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing", "to", ".", "Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.", "Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.", "All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!", "What's going on?", "So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.", "I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.", "I don't know! I didn't come with her!", "Hey you guys, guess what?", "Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it\u0092s Christmastime.

Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I\u0092m the only one who can sing \"Merry Christmas\" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.", "Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)", "Hey!", "Well, it's going okay.", "Oh, thanks!", "Wow!", "Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.", "Just get your nails done?", "Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)", "Thank you! And Happy Holidays.", "Wait, you can't take the money out.", "But, can't you leave the dollar?

Young lady, you can't\u0085 (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!", "Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!", "Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?", "Does it look like an ashtray?", "Does it look like a urinal?", "Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!", "Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.

What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)", "Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob!

Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw.

I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!", "Uh-huh!", "No!", "Yeah!", "Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.", "Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)", "Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So\u0085", "That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.", "Hey!", "Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?", "Exactly! Because it's in the past!", "Okay, then what happened?", "(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!", "Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.)

Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.", "Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.", "It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; \"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter.\" And y'know what? We", "meet at the checkout counter.", "It's Phoebe.", "Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?", "Umm, well, umm Grandma died.", "No, she just died today!

I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.", "All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.", "Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out", "Y'know it's funny, you'd", "I'd be angry. I mean, you'd", "I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.", "All right.", "Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?!

Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.", "Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!", "All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him!

So, I think you all know what I mean.", "Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.", "Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.", "All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.) How much more do we need?", "Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while.

Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!", "Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!", "I would", "it if I weren't here!", "Me?!", "Wow!

But have fun at the movie.", "You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?", "Yeah!", "You tired Chandler?", "Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.", "We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!", "What are you talking about?!", "Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

What's up?", "Yeah, I've been around.", "Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!

Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?", "So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?", "Okay, what about after I give you these candies?

It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am", "sorry.", "So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.", "Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!", "Hey!", "Yeah?", "Ohh, you are", "lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?", "But she just came up here!", "I wonder where she is. That is so weird.", "Would you stop that!

Yay!", "(sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget.

Okay lady, your lurking days are over!", "Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?", "What time? Maybe we can share a cab!", "I won! I won! I finally won!", "Fine!

Denise!", "Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time!", "Hey.", "So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?", "You didn\u0092t tell her did you?", "Of course not, because you\u0092re in love with her.", "What do you mean, comforted her?", "Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!", "Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.

Rachel\u0092s not in the same place you are.", "Okay, I didn\u0092t understand that, but y\u0092know, maybe that\u0092s \u0091cause you were speaking the secret language of love!", "Shhhhhh!

I only wish you hadn\u0092t been on the toilet.", "Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?", "Yeah, coffeehouse.", "So how are things going with Paul?", "That\u0092s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won\u0092t open.", "No that\u0092s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.", "(To Rachel) Watch this.", "Hi Paul!", "So how are things going with you?", "Yeah! That was so weird, huh?", "I didn\u0092t do it! It was Chandler! He\u0092s\u0085 He\u0092s mad at you!", "Please, I think you know why.", "Come on Ross, you\u0092re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.", "Do you think that\u0092s something that he\u0092d be mad at you for?", "Well then I think that\u0092s it.", "Oh, if that\u0092s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.", "Okay, so maybe you don\u0092t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y\u0092know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y\u0092know? Or an engagement tiara? Or\u0097ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.", "Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?", "(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.", "Or not, whatever.", "Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much", "it?", "We will give you $10.", "We stand firm at $10.", "Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I\u0092m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.", "I\u0092ll give you $1 for them.", "Okay umm, I\u0092d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too much?", "Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something\u0092s missing. It\u0092s not\u0085 Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.", "Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store\u0092s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)", "Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)", "Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It\u0092s over!", "Some guy bought it. I\u0092m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!", "The little jail between the doors!", "I know, I\u0092m sorry! But y\u0092know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.", "Maybe it was the guy.", "(entering from her room) Hey.", "It\u0092s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It\u0092s a beautiful ring!", "Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. \u0091Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.", "Well you certainly can\u0092t give her that stupid gumball ring.", "There he is! (Points.)", "Wow! You\u0092re good! After this, we should solve crimes.", "Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.", "It is your office.", "John?", "(To Chandler) Here he is.", "Wow! I would trade.", "Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman\u0092s heart?", "Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I\u0092m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity\u0085", "(entering) Hi.", "What?", "Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.", "Yeah!", "If she says no, can I have the ring?", "", "!", "(with her mouthful) Hi Monica.", "It\u0092s gone.", "(To Chandler) We\u0092re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)", "Open bar?", "I can do that for the kids.", "Y\u0092know, you are 12 years older than her.", "Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)", "Here.", "So now what\u0092s going on here?", "No, I know what a silent is I meant, what\u0092s going on with your hair?", "No! It\u0092s nice!", "Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)", "Hey you guys! Look!", "I got me some drinks!", "Open bar!", "You just can\u0092t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can\u0092t you?", "Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]", "Well, just buy the damn boat! (She\u0092s still working her way through her tray of booze.)", "I\u0092m just helping the kids!", "Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.", "Oh, okay.", "It\u0092s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she\u0092s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?", "Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)", "Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)", "I wanna see what\u0092s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.", "Eww! Oh, it\u0092s all dirty. You should throw this out.", "What happened?", "Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor\u0085", "Good one! Yeah.", "Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn\u0092t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.", "Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you\u0092re scared of commitment! Convince her that you\u0092re a little coward!", "No, you\u0092re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!", "I know, they\u0092re gonna be", "happy together.", "", "that often!", "Me too! So happy for them!", "Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!", "Totally. I\u0092m like 90/10.", "Definitely!", "What do you mean?", "You mean a backup?", "Yeah, yeah I got that.", "Hm-mmm.", "Joey.", "Yeah!", "Yeah, I locked him years ago!", "Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.", "Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were\u0085 (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)", "Well hey, it\u0092s just a backup.", "Of course I can! It\u0092s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I\u0092ve already lost Chandler!", "I don\u0092t\u0097Look I don\u0092t know what you\u0092re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!", "Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we\u0092re married!", "All right well let\u0092s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat\u0097This is hard!", "No wait! Just\u0097Okay\u0097Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don\u0092t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.", "(To Rachel) I\u0092m talking about massages.", "Good!", "Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.", "(reading) Ross!", "Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)", "Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn\u0092t here!", "Oh no, let her stay out there. It\u0092s sweet.", "So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y\u0092know, I\u0092m kinda musical.", "Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?", "Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!", "Oh honey no, you ate it all.", "Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)", "If you would\u0092ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he\u0092s probably not gay.", "I\u0092m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)", "Really?! Oh that\u0092s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I\u0092ll have to pound on you for a little bit.", "Okay. (She goes to get ready.)", "You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?", "What a great night, Chandler can\u0092t do it, these guys kissed\u0085 (Points to Ross and Rachel.)", "Well yeah, that and Chandler\u0092s problem.", "Okay, so", "! Okay, we\u0092ll get us some Mai Thai\u0092s, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.", "Why?!", "(she\u0092s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think I\u0092ll play it at the wedding.", "Well, I don\u0092t think Monica is gonna take this away.", "Would she?", "Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I\u0092m just gonna need a small deposit.", "Y\u0092know, just some good faith money to hold the date.", "Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)", "Y\u0092know, I don\u0092t really their permission.", "Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you\u0085 You gotta do something about your eyes.", "They give you away! There\u0092s just-there\u0092s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.", "Maybe just 10 minutes for you.", "(singing, angrily)", "(singing)", "Oh thank you.", "Now\u0085 (Starts singing again) \"", "\u0097(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)\u0097Oh\u0097oh!

Ross!", "I need to talk to you, it\u0092s pretty urgent. It\u0092s about Monica and Chandler.", "Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y\u0092know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?", "Nothing\u0097Why?!", "Oh yeah it is! I\u0092m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.", "(to the students) Oh, I\u0092m sorry.

I did it at Monica and Chandler\u0092s!", "(pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?", "Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don\u0092t know what the big deal is!", "(gasps) My God! What did you order?!", "Look, why don\u0092t you just pay for it yourself?", "(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.", "Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.", "(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!", "My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.", "He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.", "Well, he\u0092s never coming back!

I wish you a long and happy marriage.", "Come on, it\u0092s not that big a deal!", "Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?", "Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.", "Are there anymore from the good batch? \u0091Cause we could just work off of those.", "Y\u0092know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we\u0092re trying to figure out her recipe.

(Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!", "Huh?", "Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.", "No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.

Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.", "Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.", "Yeah, why not?", "Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?", "Really? So she said, she didn\u0092t wanna live with me anymore?", "You're sure? You're absolutely sure?", "Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.

That doesn\u0092t give you the right to ditch me!", "I don\u0092t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up.

I took out your battery! How can\u0085", "Don\u0092t interrupt me!!", "Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.)

Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh!

How did you do it?!", "Oo, where are the seats?", "Okay, now would you say that that\u0092s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?", "Then that\u0092s not breaking the law! I\u0092m there!", "Yeah?", "He\u0092s awfully short and I think he\u0092s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he\u0092s not that good in bed.", "Wait a second!

Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?", "Hey!", "Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.", "Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.", "Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).", "My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?", "Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?", "Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it\"!", "Well...it's not about quality.", "Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.", "Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?", "What are people having, the garlic Martini?", "(singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..", "You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.", "Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!", "(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!", "Ok, ok, how many of you", "the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!", "Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?", "Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).", "Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)", "I'm sorry too... (they hug)", "Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...", "(smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?", "What is it?", "I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?", "Hi!", "Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?", "Ah, ah.", "Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!", "Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?", "And that horrible museum tour!", "We know about your party Joey.", "Hey!", "Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where", "Chandler anyway? (Looks around)", "Hey Ross!", "Oh, What's the matter?", "Worse?", "(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)", "Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?", "Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.", "You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...", "Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!", "Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!", "Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.", "Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get", "!", "(entering) Hey!", "Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)", "I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.", "Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)", "(coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!", "No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these \"big massage places\"! They're putting people like me out of business!", "Ok, this is not about the", ", ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.", "Well, do you care about friendship?", "I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.", "Promise?", "Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)", "Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?", "But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.", "'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!", "(watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?", "(In a strange heavy accent) Hello \"ja\", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.", "Okay, then I'm Swedish...", "It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...", "Ja!", "(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!", "Is something wrong?", "(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.", "(Singing) \"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! \" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)", "Oh, Ja! Ja!", "Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?", "Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!", "You know it's me?", "How can you come here?", "I don't have to tell you everything!", "Tips not included.", "Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and", "paying taxes!", "You know what? You are right. I", "gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!", "Ok.", "Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean", "of that. I love you.", "(imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.", "Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?", "(through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.", "(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?", "Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like \"Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!\". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!", "Exactly!", "(after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh,", "Ok, that'll be great!", "Oh, I'll take some of that.", "No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.", "Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!", "(picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?", "Ok!", "So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?", "Why?", "Who else?", "You like Joey?", "(whispering) Oh my God!", "Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?", "Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.", "Yeah.", "Sure!", "Oh.", "Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?", "Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.", "(sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!", "(goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.", "(comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.", "Ooh! We have a problem.", "Good plan.", "Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at \"who's more over who\"! (at which she walks away)", "Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.", "Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.", "You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.", "David?", "Oh my God! (they hug)", "Yeah. What-what are you doing here?", "What happened?", "Yeah?", "Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?", "Good!", "(disappointed) Oh, good for you.", "Mike and I broke up.", "Really?", "I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!", "Well... (pause) no.", "I'd love to.", "Ok. (they walk away together)", "Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.", "I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.", "No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.", "Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.", "", "?? Who's Mike?", "That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!", "Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard", "the time!", "I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?", "Yeah.", "You just did it again.", ", your feelings for", "are certainly gone!", "(shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!", "", "Joey.", "Yeah?", "Are you leaving \"The Supremes\"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)", "Wow? Really? That's fantastic!", "Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and", "him down the aisle. I can just see it: \"Mike, do you take Phoebe...\" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout \"No! No!\") You know, it's", "girl's dream!", "Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike...", "! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!", "Sure, ok, yeah.", "Oh my God, Mike!", "No, Mike's here.", "What are you, what are you doing here?", "(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!", "I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.", "David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.", "Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.", "Yes! (they hug)", "Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!", "... and...?", "All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!", "Nobody wins!", "Yeah, I'm out.", "Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!", "No idea! I though he was soft like you!", "(picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.", "Tails!", "(smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!", "(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?", "C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!", "(pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!", "(to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.", "Mike wins?", "You can't do that!", "Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.", "It's like watching porn!"]}
